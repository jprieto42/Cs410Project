# CS410 Project - Medical Device Reviews Data Set Creation
## Project Description
The purpose of the project is to create data sets comprised of reviews of medical device sellers and their products. To do this, custom python code was written to scrape the data off of websites, and clean the data as well. The intended use of the data sets created was for sentiment analysis, however it can be used for other Natural Language Processing Purposes as well. I chose to create separate data sets because each source has different fields of information avialable.
## Data Sets
