The machine does what I need it to and I like how it can be set up. Strokes suck, but this machine helps rehabilitate.

6	Linda	Va. Beach, va	06/04/2023	5	Tens unit	This is my 3rd one I have bought. I bought one for myself , and bought each of my daughters one, for their birthdays. After using mine, they loved the results. I bought them each some supplies to go with them, and they are set. Now I don’t have to lend mine out, and really need it when someone else is using it. I also gave another friend the order info for your online order site, and she wants to buy one too. My husband has been using mine too, as he also likes it. Need I say more about your product. As you can see, we think it’s really great.	InTENSity Twin Stim III Digital TENS & EMS Combo Unit + Free AC Adapter Included	https://www.tenspros.com/
7	Anita	Atlanta, GA	03/26/2023	4	Ms.	Product works as advertised and has been helping with the improvements we needed. Also, most people might need a professional to explain where/how to properly place the electrodes. Only issue is that the electrodes lose their stickiness very quickly; easy fix is to clean after every use (just that it is inconvenient). Otherwise happy with the purchase.

11	Paul Richardson	Kelseyville	07/04/2022	4	Mr.	Excellent product with somewhat obscure documentation. Once you have worked with the unit, the documentation becomes easier to interpret, but it is not well organized, and is confusing for someone that is not technically inclined or experienced with electronics.

13	Dr Tom Robertson	Odenton, MD	03/23/2022	5	Doctor of Chiropractic	"I've been using TENSpro's products for a long time and was happy to see this particular inexpensive programmable unit. I have been using a relatively new therapy for stress relief in patients called Transcutaneous Vagus Nerve Stimulation (tVNS) which requires a specific range for pulse rate. This unit is exactly what I need for my patients--I've been recommending that they get it along with the metallic-rubber earclips that are required for tVNS. Glad that TENSpros are able to keep up the supply for my increasing demand from my patients! tVNS may help with PTSD, tinnitus, inflammation reduction, possibly even hypertension and digestive disorders--anything that gets dys-regulated when over-stress causes vagus nerve ""disruption""."

21	Joe	MADISON	08/08/2021	5	user	I purchased this unit because I have been having dull aching back and leg pain. I was surprised that after the first treatment, the pain seemed less intense. Not miraculously gone, but it was more tolerable to function with. I have been seeing a chiropractor who asked me to bring in the unit. After looking it over and downloading the manual for me, she printed out some recommended settings for me to use and told me I had purchased a very good unit. I have been following her recommendations and I can honestly say it has helped me function a lot better. I got a very good price for the unit and some of the associated equipment. It was a very good investment for me and I would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone who has some type of pain or discomfort. There are quite a few settings to choose from and the best thing to do is experiment with what feels best for your specific condition. No complaints about it from me	InTENSity Twin Stim III Digital TENS & EMS Combo Unit + Free AC Adapter Included	https://www.tenspros.com/
22	Lynda Goodwin	Oregon	07/10/2021	5	Ms	This product has been very effective in relieving pain when other options have not worked. I am very thankful for the pain relief.	InTENSity Twin Stim III Digital TENS & EMS Combo Unit + Free AC Adapter Included	https://www.tenspros.com/
23	john dixon	ocala	05/23/2021	5	mr	We love this equipment. My wife has weak wrists and was in constant pain, using copper gloves to support her wrists. But with the TENS she now only uses the cloves at her repetitive motion job.	InTENSity Twin Stim III Digital TENS & EMS Combo Unit + Free AC Adapter Included	https://www.tenspros.com/
24	F Louise Smith	Apple Valley	04/09/2021	5	My new Tens unit	Several years ago, my back surgeon at Cedars-Sinai hospital recommended I get a tens unit for chronic back pain following major surgery, which I did for many years, off and on. Then came a need recently for a flair up of pain and I dug out the old unit. It had been stored too long I guess and did not function as well. I ordered your unit, received it promptly and use it when ever I feel the need for relief! Works great, you can increase or lower the intensity easily and I am very pleased to have a very good product handy when the need for relaxation arises. It is also very handy to be able to be mobile and worn everywhere as you keep a busy schedule. You do not have to recline or be stationary to use. Love it!!!

27	Donna	Illinois	01/08/2021	5	Mrs	I am a nurse practitioner. This product was recommended to me by a patient with chronic back pain. It was recommended to him by his neurologist. I ordered one for my husband for his hip pain, but after trying it on my neck, I use it more than he does. The instruction book is difficult to navigate but we have figured out how to use the tens portion and it is amazing. It is well worth the investment.

31	SJ Bryant	Idaho, USA	11/21/2020	5	Patient, former biomedical technologist	My physical therapist recommended this specific model. Well, as an old biomed tech I had to do my own homework and check out all the other models and other suppliers. Spent hours looking carefully at all the available data. Bottom line- I don't see how you could do better than this unit for basic TENS. The EMS mode is a very nice option to have as well, though I personally haven't needed it. This unit has the perfect amount of settings and options. It is well designed and efficient. My PT knew exactly how to get his patients the best device at an unbelievably low price. Would absolutely recommend this to others.	InTENSity Twin Stim III Digital TENS & EMS Combo Unit + Free AC Adapter Included	https://www.tenspros.com/

35	Paul Hogan	United Kingdom	07/20/2020	5	Mr	"Excellent Rehabilitation aid for re engaging hand function after a stroke , bought the tens three for my wife , its early days yet but there is a marked improvement and she is able to flex her fingers and hold items ,
still with a week grip but its a vast improvement and thanks to the Specialist who has put instructions on YouTube , the future looks bright .
The ramp function or the rate at which the power builds up and falls is particularly good and controllable , a function not readily available on a vast number of Tens machines which generally have set programs and limited control ."

55	gazman01	Gainesville	01/05/2020	4	Great NMES Unit	Had a different brand from different supplier and it was not intense enough. The InTENSity III has been great for me anterior tibialis muscele regeneration after an anterior tibial nerve injury. All the NMES settings are perfect for my recovery and healing, especial the intensity. And much less expensive than what the PT facility wanted to charge me. This unity has helped my nerve and muscle recovery greatly. The only cons are that the instruction manual is lacking in clarity and that I can not turn the ramp feature off completely to do a one second on, one second off to time it to my walking.

86	Ugur	BOSTON	05/08/2018	5	Cost-effective!	I bought this product after having been diagnosed with shoulder impingement. I use TENS for pain management, and EMS for strenghtening muscles around the shoulder. I have benefited appreciably. My physio confirmed that the parameters in a pretty acceptable range, and they do not have to be as sophisticated as their devices' have. I would recommend this product. I could add that the pads last more than 10 uses as long as they are applied over a precleaned skin.

87	Ed	Tennessee	05/01/2018	5	It works for me!	"In the several weeks that I've owned the ""InTENSity Twin Stim III Digital TENS & EMS Combo Unit"" I've found it to be a very useful and high quality device. However, a few weeks after I bought it, I also bought a ""Twin Stim Plus 3rd Edition - 4 Channel Digital TENS, EMS, IF & Russian Unit"" and if you don't mind spending the extra money, you also get ""IF"" which I've found to be quite a bit better than just TENS alone. I highly recommend both units. The IF offers more pain relief than just the TENS but it requires at least 2 channels (4 electrodes) in a cross configuration, so depending on the location of the pain, you can't always use it but in most cases you can still use the TENS. If you have pain and haven't tried a TENS and/or IF unit... what are you waiting for?"	InTENSity Twin Stim III Digital TENS & EMS Combo Unit + Free AC Adapter Included	https://www.tenspros.com/

96	Heike McConnell	Bartow FL	10/18/2017	5	Mrs	I have chronic shoulder pain due to impingement and tendonitis, with occasional flare ups in pain. After using this product a few times my pain has been greatly reduced. The effectiveness of this TENS unit is comparable to what was used on me during physical therapy. I especially like that you can adjust the pair of electrodes independently with regard to intensity. I also chose this unit because you can both use AC power or batteries. This saves on batteries when I am using the unit at home while sitting on the couch.	InTENSity Twin Stim III Digital TENS & EMS Combo Unit + Free AC Adapter Included	https://www.tenspros.com/

100	Laura	Beatrice	07/03/2017	4	Intensity TwinStim	This TENS unit has provided me with substantial relief from radiculopathy associated with spinal nerve compression. While it doesn't cure or completely relieve the discomfort, it does reduce it and make more tolerable. It is not a treatment, but another pain management tool for my toolkit. 4 stars, rather than 5 because it took me a bit to figure out how to use the settings; the instructions could have been simpler.

103	Mark Hanna	Sierra Vista	05/07/2017	5	End User	Very satisfied with my tens unit. Wall adapter connection to unit seems a little fragile but works fine. Be sure to wash and dry your skin where you intend to place electrodes so they will stay on correctly. When you peel the electrodes off, pull near the wire with a slow steady pull. Once off wipe sticky side quickly with an alcohol wipe, let it dry then place back on the plastic sheet. This will extend the life of the pads.

106	Evelyn C.	Florida	03/28/2017	4	Mrs	I have been using the TENS unit on a daily basis. It helps the pain because I do not have to use pain medication, so it is working.

120	(Verified Buyer) Markie Madden	Missouri	06/08/2016	5	Mrs.	I just got the machine today. I used it on my aching knee and it took the pain away very quickly! I suffer from fibromyalgia as well as migraines. Recent changes to pain medications and controlled substances, I can no longer get the medicine I used for pain. I sought out the TENS Unit to fill that void. I also used it on my lower back and my shoulder, and it seems to work! So far so good, and I think it's worth the money. Also, when I had a question, I turned to Tenspro on their Facebook page, and they quickly gave me the answer.

121	Leslie	California	04/24/2016	4	--	"The TENS unit works great, helped a lot vs terrible pains in muscles, spine & also vs nerve pain.BUT the 2x2"" white cloth Electrodes are a BIG disappointment.

122	Sean	Los Luna's NM	04/14/2016	3	Mr	The reason I gave this unit 3 stars is because this... It is very complex to use, once you play around with the settings and figure out what works best for you. The directons are a waist of time. There are better units on the market that have easy settings in the same price range, if I knew what I know now I would not have chosen this model. Battery life is great on this model but having to replace 9v gets costly after a while, other brands offer a rechargeable unit that can charge off USB. The reusable pads state reusable but after only 2 uses they do not stick, cleaning and preping skin does not help the pads to stay sticky. Only good thing my pads came with a little 2oz bottle of electrolyte spray that rehydrates them, I get one extra use on the pads and a little bit goes a long way.. I do not recommend this product to the average person it has way to many settings. Once you figure them out write down your Preferences incase the unit resets. Once my unit I bought needs to be replaced I will be getting a healthmateforever brand. I strongly recommend you research them before chosing this intensity one	InTENSity Twin Stim III Digital TENS & EMS Combo Unit + Free AC Adapter Included	https://www.tenspros.com/

151	Michael	North Adams MA	06/01/2015	5	Finally relief !!	First off the twin stim 3 is a god sent . I have owned the unit for 3 days now and I have had zero pain in my foot or back . Previously I have owned different stim units but I'm not sure if they used tens at all they seemed to be more like massagers . There is a bit of a learning curve with this unit . I have done a lot of research online and found settings to start with that work great I have experimented with settings as well and got great relief from my exploration . Ems is a great tool and has some great properties to it for relaxing muscles as well as giving individual muscles a slight work out. The pad that come with the unit are only ok I have used them for 3 days and to be honest they are already losing there stickiness so you will definitely will have to order more pad when ordering your unit . With the twin stim 3 I bought large butterfly pads as well as a long strip for my back and they both work great the long strip is the best nothing has relived my back pain like this has it hits all the right spots and not on my spine definitely if you suffer from back pain pick up a few of these strips they work outstandingly great . I would recommend this unit to a friend in a heart beat and have told many people about this this treatment for pain. If something were to happen I would buy this unit in a heartbeat all over again I'm totally satisfied .

155	John	Oklahoma	04/19/2015	4	I Like It	"Works very well for my nerve pain. It elimates the pain for days.
I don't use the battery feature, but if I did it would have to be rechargeable.
Instructions are very vage, has a learning curve to it. I think it could have been made easer to use. Rateing it 4 stars for the not ease of use, other than that it works for me which I'm happy about. Don't take pain pills anymore."

It's simple to set up and use in just a few moments and the battery has lasted a very long time.I have recommended this unit to friends and I would buy a second unit if my wife didn't share this one!

I had some issues with learning to use the product, but your customer service person was very professional in explaining the issues I had. I had a knee replacement and thought the TENS unit really helped to keep the swelling down. My husband has had some back problems and he uses the TENS almost every day. Overall... Good product and good service.	InTENSity Twin Stim III Digital TENS & EMS Combo Unit + Free AC Adapter Included	https://www.tenspros.com/

162	Leo LaSalle	Anaconda MT	01/15/2015	5	retired database administrator	There is dizzying number of TENS, EMS and TENS/EMS units on the market. I select InTENSity based upon their time in the market and a record of continuously upgrading the product. I selected the Twin Stim III -- it has worked well for me in both modes. It was purchased for chronic back pain, it helps a lot -- it has also been used for very painful muscle spasms quite effectively. It has good battery life.

163	Cameron	Mandeville, Louisiana	01/14/2015	5	Mr.	Wasn't sure about TENS when I was searching. One of my co workers swore by it for his back pain. So, I bought this unit. And the whole family loves it. It really did the job for me as well. It doesn't solve the problem if you have a chronic injury. But while it's on, the pain is gone! Feels great! Has a lot of thump for such a small unit. I figured only the A/C power would be strong...nope, strong battery power also. I have enjoyed this unit and would buy it again.

This unit has helped with issues that the chiropractor could not help. It has given him relief at times that he has never been able to get relief prior. Great product for anyone. Great value for the money. You can't put a price tag on pain relief, but thank you for providing a product that does what it does for a reasonable price!

Two reasons I give it 4 stars vs. 5 ....it beeps with each and every change as you set it up. This is a problem if you use it at night and sleep in the same room as someone else. Also, it is not user friendly....you must really pay attention to the manual (and even then it is confusing).

181	Nancy	Illinois	07/18/2014	4	Pain Relief	I have been suffering from low back pain for months. Don't like to take too many pain meds. As soon as I put this unit on, it gave relief of the pain. It is wonderful. It is very comfortable. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that it shuts itself off so much. I have it set to remain on continuously. Many times when I just turn it on or increase the intensity, as soon as I hook it to my belt, it goes back to zero and I have to reset it.

196	IreneT	State College	12/02/2023	5	Love the Manual Units...Simple Operation	"This is so reasonably priced for those of us on a fixed budget. I do not care for digital. I'm older and can't see smart phone screens and screens on digital aren't any better. I tried the digital and too much messing around. I am not interested. In this day and age people forget those that just like to set a little switch and turn it on. It makes life much happier especially when one is in pain.
This is my second purchase because after time (several years) there is a part of the battery compartment that gets pushed in and the battery no long fits to operate the unit. It's probably something they can rectify if consumers let them know. But I certainly got my monies worth on the first purchase. Please do not stop making these manual models. Great TENS 3000!"

262	Linda Ohlsen	Carlsbad	07/22/2021	5	purchaser	Amazing. I'm new to TENS. Chose the analog unit for simplicity and instant control. I was nervous about digital programing but very happy with the easy use of this analog device. I had a recurring muscle spasm (right flank) for six months. Regardless of what activity I was doing, the spasm occurred in the same place and almost every day to some degree. TENS masked the pain initially which allowed me to continue my activities and not get grumpy due to discomfort. After 3 days the spasms didn't come back. It's been 29 days since my last episode. I'm not ready yet to report that TENS actually cured the problem, but WOW, what a difference! BTW, had 10 mosquito bites on my ankles recently, used TENS and it worked. The intense itch did not come back the next day. Thank you!	TENS 3000 3 Mode Analog TENS Unit with Timer	https://www.tenspros.com/

Then I began using it on my bad lower back. Ah, Relief! I use it every morning on the sacrum and hips. I'm pain-free all day. I liked the TENS so well I bought them for both brothers who have bad backs.
One brother had shoulder surgery & the PT used one on him. When he told the PT he had one at home the PT said, Use it!"". I just sent one to a dear friend to help her with her back when she overdoes yard work,
I cannot say enough good things about using this TENS. It is inexpensive, uses a 9V battery and does amazing things for the body. I've also used it for a stiff neck, knot between my shoulder blade and spine."	TENS 3000 3 Mode Analog TENS Unit with Timer	https://www.tenspros.com/

290	Genae	Alabama	01/01/2021	5	Tens 3000	I went through a lot of physical therapy and really appreciated the small time that I had with different units prescribed. $800.00 units are crazy and not covered by insurance. I have bought several units from Tenspro over the years, worth the money easily once you have worn one out & it takes a lot to conquer the little unit that CAN! I’m never disappointed, I run 2 units on constant to alleviate my struggles and I don’t know what I would do without them. I’ve never known the word relax in my life, with the units & pads I can function more easily having less pain. I’m thankful for the relationship with Tenspro as my supplier & I honestly near fainted when I found the site, originally I bought more pads and cordage. Finding the units at such affordable prices keep me from giving up on myself. Great investment if you are already familiar with having to send an expensive unit back through your Dr. they are the same units or lesser. Life savers I must say ??

It is easy to place the pads and the ease of turning the strength up or down has allowed me to be able to get up and move so much easier. The only drawback is the battery.

359	JP	PA	04/28/2020	5	Pleasant Surprise	To see if my dysautonomia could be improved through vagus nerve tone, I got a set of 2mm ear clips and this TENS 3000 unit. The brand new unit arrived quickly in good condition, was easy (analog adjustments) to set to desired settings, and was compatible with the ear clips. It was already evident during the first week of use (5 min every-other-day) that the vagus nerve was stimulated, and by the end of the second week (10 min) my symptoms were notably altered. I no longer have any doubt that VNS 'works', and only wish I had tried it earlier. Given the low price of this unit, it was certainly worth the try.

386	John W	Care Medical Center	02/19/2020	5	DME Coordinator	TENS Pros are the best in the business. Gary has been super helpful as well as all of the other customer representatives I have talked to. You can't beat the value that you are getting from TENS Pros especially when you order in bulk. The label design process has been super easy, and the turn around has been quick from Gary and the graphic designers. All of our clinic phone numbers are on the TENS pads we give to the patients as well as our main office and website on the front of the TENS unit box! I highly recommend TENS Pros, and I am glad we found a new supplier that has been reliable and prompt in everything they do!	TENS 3000 3 Mode Analog TENS Unit with Timer	https://www.tenspros.com/

413	Walter Schmitt	Round Lake Beach	09/27/2019	5	Leader	"Great little unit specially for that price! Everything has to be adjusted manually, pulse width, frequency and amplitude. So you have to know what you are doing, it has no pre set programs except for a 3 mode switch. Also you can not set ramp and treatment on/off times, just total treatment time 15/30/60 minutes, which prevents you from creating a preset program which you can just let run it's course. This unit is best for simple applications, you don't have to dig through menus to set parameters. Output strength is ok, for some applications it's plenty, with others I was looking for a little more power.
The unit is good for first time users, to experiment with the different parameters on themselves or others to see what it does and how it feels. Also for the experienced user for a quick simple treatment. The device is very lite but seems robust, battery life is good."	TENS 3000 3 Mode Analog TENS Unit with Timer	https://www.tenspros.com/

The electrodes are reusable, I’d suggest ordering extras at time of your order to avoid waiting on a second shipment. I used mine daily in intervals all day as I was recovering from my back going out. I wore the electrodes all day till I took them off at bed time. Due to my duration and long use I wore out the electrode patch.....it still stuck, but the wire was coming loose. I ordered 4 more units for my boys who work construction and 3 extra sets of electrodes for all. We are all extreamly pleased with the quality of the unit and all parts that accompany it.

I loved mine so much, and obviously he did, as well, so I thought it was a good fit for him. I would never use anything else, after using the tens for pain. It is reliable and you can set the controls for a good relief of whatever pain you might have.	TENS 3000 3 Mode Analog TENS Unit with Timer	https://www.tenspros.com/

537	Andrea	Anaheim	02/18/2018	4	Pain relief day or night	"I purchased this to replace my last one that broke. I dropped it a few times, then it stopped working.
The pros: you can use this on essentially any place on your body. You can adjust the level for your comfort and preference. There is a timer so it will automatically turn off, if you prefer. You can fall asleep with it on. There are two outlets so you can use one or two sets of pads for additional relief.
Cons: the pads lose their stickiness rather quickly. They do not stick well to the neck (they are better for flat surfaces of the body rather than curved). If a pad is not completely stuck to you it will make a funny electricity noise and shock you.
The batteries drain really quickly. You have to be very diligent about turning it off when not in use."	TENS 3000 3 Mode Analog TENS Unit with Timer	https://www.tenspros.com/

545	C M Morris	stonewall	02/01/2018	5	Ms	"On the recommendation of my Physical Therapist, I got the VERY reasonably priced Tenspro 3000 for use after a total shoulder replacement. Placed at 48 hours post-op to my front and back upper chest region, the Tenspro effectively decreased my pain and even more importantly in these times, I am certain it diminished my need for medication!
Easy to use and place, I learned that it tucked nicely into my jacket pocket. It was easy to program and although I could reuse the electrodes a few times, I was pleased I had purchased additional.
The phone order went quickly and was very pleased by the helpful staff who assisted me.
The only negative was that it devoured my 9v batteries, and these needed changing ever 1-2 days. I also would have liked a color selection, but that is a comparatively minuscule concern."	TENS 3000 3 Mode Analog TENS Unit with Timer	https://www.tenspros.com/

552	Robin	Springfield MO	01/20/2018	5	Mrs.	"I purchased this TENS unit about a month ago. I am pleased this it's performance. It has allowed me to return to work. The doctor recommended an analog TENS unit because the digital ones have a small screen which makes it difficult to read and more complicated to use. I tried to purchase electrodes at a local medical supply store and they wanted 10.00 for the exact same item you can buy here for 1.95. However I would suggest you purchase as many extra electrodes you can afford at the same time you buy the unit because they charge 6.00 S&H when you order them at a later date. Same thing for the 9 volt batteries. We purchased several at Batteries Plus and they were 1.50 each versus .95 here. You will want to carry an extra battery with you if you are away from home. When the battery runs out it gives you a pulse warning that is just like the ""burst"" pattern on the TENS unit. I learned the hard way also that you only need to turn one dial if you are using only one set of electrodes.

The machine works well to relieve pain and I would recommend it to anyone with similar problems. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is the $15 shipping cost.

645	(Verified Buyer) Michelle Seefried	My home	02/27/2017	5	Best thing I've bought for MYSELF!!	"I am so glad that I decided to Google tens units and found your website. I honestly didn't have a lot of $$$, so I had to look at inexpensive units. When I found this one on sale I was SO excited
I read the specs, and it sounded like a pretty good deal at 80? off.
Thank you so much TensPro! And I hope whoever reads this is now more inclined to buy this unit. It might just be the best decision you've made!!!
Then only thing I would recommend to improve this purchase would be to add an extra set of pads in it."	TENS 3000 3 Mode Analog TENS Unit with Timer	https://www.tenspros.com/
646	Dina	Brooklyn	02/25/2017	5	R.	I ordered TENS 3000 for my husband. He has knee pain and swelling which is getting worse when he had to walk more than usual. We had 9 days very active vacation with a lot of walking and even biking. He used TENS every evening and was able to NOT take painkillers! I would recommend this product to everyone. Just keep in mind that it may take 2-3 procedures before you start feeling changes. I ordered another item for my relative for neck/shoulders pain. I hope it will help as well.

657	Oh, my achin' back!	11421	01/08/2017	3	So far, so good	Having bought one of these units (new!) at a local garage sale last summer, I finally got around to trying it today...my back has been hurting..having run out of narcotics (there is nothing like a good narcotic for pain!), I thought I'd give TENS a try. It DOES make a difference but I need leave a wide berth for placebo aside from experimenting with settings.

She attaches all four pads and relaxes into it. This combined with chiropractic care have saved her and her job until she can retire in a few years. Amazing and affordable device.

665	Andrew L. Darlas	Newport News	12/23/2016	5	Mr	"My Chiropractor was going to be away for 5 days I had been in a car wreck where my shoulders and back where giving me fits. He had aliegned my back okay but the muscles and nerves where shoot on this 63 year old guy. So he loaned me a Tens 3000. for the 5 days or ever how long I needed it. I also had Arthritis pain off and on and couldn't raise my arms over my shoulders for the pain would return. I used the TENS when I hurt for 15 minutes on I believe 2000 area and 2000 pulse setting. I bumped it (the button) once and man if you are not careful it will zap ya good.
But after 4 days of using it only when I hurt and each day was farther apart until I didn't need it, But occasionally when I have worked my arms over 6 hours. I believe with the TENS and the supervision of my Chiropractor companation has speeded up my healling process. The shoulder pain had been there for many years. If I knew this was out there , I would have bought one years ago. The price was reasonable and I would have paid (and recoment) the full price of 80 + dollars I thought it was going to cost me 100s. Even then I would have been leary but I can say 100 is well worth having as little pain as I have had, compared to the pain where I had limited movement. I have a problem with my knee also every so often it hurts , so I have moved the pads to the knee and it only takes one or 2 treatments (a few hours apart) to hellp my steps and not limp.
It has been noticed that I am moving by my friends and that alone has got them thinking even they might try this not so new idea. amazed me and them we had never heard of anyone using one or available."	TENS 3000 3 Mode Analog TENS Unit with Timer	https://www.tenspros.com/

736	VJ	Hanford, CA	02/23/2016	4	Ms.	I really like this product. The levels of intensity are great. My only problem is the pads that are provided with it. The pads are small and they lose their ability to stick very quickly. I think larger pads would be great with the original unit instead of these small cheap ones. I love the fact that the unit shuts itself off and you can adjust the time to 10, 20 or 30 minutes a pop. But don't forget to turn it off. Even though the charge shuts off the unit doesn't and the batteries will run down. If you want to add more time you will have to shut it off and turn it back on again. But it is a great unit and handy, you can clip it to you and move around with it.	TENS 3000 3 Mode Analog TENS Unit with Timer	https://www.tenspros.com/

We have been very happy with this unit. It is very well made and works great. The only problem I have had is I dropped the thing the first day and the latch on the case broke so I need to use something to hold it closed. We use it all the time and are very happy with it. The price was about 1/5 of what my friend paid for his unit. Great purchase. I think I have had at least 2 friends purchase one since I got this unit.

Only comment to change:
It would be nice if it beeped when its about to go ""off."" I don't always realize its off as this wastes energy & can go run out @inconvenient time.
All & all great product!

816	George	Atlanta	05/02/2015	5	Amazing	This product is amazing!! I am one of those people who carry stress in my shoulders and neck. With this machine I can relive most of the tension as soon as I start to feel it plus it's small so I can throw it in my bag for work and use it in the office. The price alone has me considering a third one. Not the same as a massage but very close.	TENS 3000 3 Mode Analog TENS Unit with Timer	https://www.tenspros.com/

818	Dave	Virginia	04/28/2015	5	Groovy gadget!	"I've been using my TENS3000 for a while now, and it's amazing! I have sciatica and general back pain, and shoulder pain from torn rotator cuff. Just slap on the electrodes, turn on the TENS unit, and ZAP! the pain is gone. It's a simple, easy to use alternative to pills, heating pads, ointments, etc. Also it's totally portable(carry in a pocket or use belt clip)and has fairly good battery life. The only drawback is there's no place to hook up an AC adapter. I'll solve that with a couple rechargeable batteries/charger.
Overall very happy with this purchase."	TENS 3000 3 Mode Analog TENS Unit with Timer	https://www.tenspros.com/

824	Clive	New York	04/11/2015	5	Lost & Found	"I ordered 3000 and the 7000 units, and after several weeks of trying to make a claim, I found the package in the backyard after weeks of snow melted. The USPS threw the package over the fence, into the backyard.
The units were in excellent condition, however, the batteries were in poor health and I replaced them. I was surprised to find both units working well. The padded envelope did a wonderful job.
The Tens 3000 is the real deal and I have no problem recommending it.

833	BRIGITTE	California	03/09/2015	5	delighted	"About 8 month ago I over-exerted one knee and as a result was in severe pain. Every step hurt. Diagnosis: ""Osteonecrosis within the medial femoral condyle."" The doctor was eager to set me up for a knee replacement. ""It won't heal"".
But my acupuncturist recommended a TENS unit. He told me if I used it daily ""for a year"" I had a good chance of ending up with a healed knee. When my doctors didn't want to prescribe one I was delighted to find such a device on line for a surprisingly small amount of money. I have been using the unit daily for 20 minutes during my morning prayers since then and it wasn't long before the pain was gone and the knee functional, ready to be exercised and strengthened.
I'm grateful. And I have been spreading the good news. Please feel free to use any part or all of this lengthy testimonial."	TENS 3000 3 Mode Analog TENS Unit with Timer	https://www.tenspros.com/

839	Elaine	Ventnor, New Jersey	03/01/2015	5	Pain Relief	This TENS unit works very well in helping to alleviate chronic lower back pain or sciatic nerve pain. I don't know how well it would work for other areas of pain, but I did get some relief for my back issues. It comes equipped with everything you need including the battery. In time, I will probably need to re-order the gel pads, but I've used them several times already and they are still holding up quite well with repeated applications. I would recommend this product to anyone with chronic back pain.	TENS 3000 3 Mode Analog TENS Unit with Timer	https://www.tenspros.com/

The battery that comes with it is a little suspect so if you are going to be traveling with it don't forget to take a spare with you. Or better yet, just put a good one in to start and it should last for awhile. I would recommend this unit to anyone. I give it to any patient who needs it.

I googled TENS units and found this site. I spent over 2 hours looking at products, reading reviews, price shopping, etc... The next day, while checking my email, an ad for the TENS Pro 3000 was on the page. The price of $16.50 caught my attention. So I went back to the website, did a little more info gathering and decided to purchase one.
I have severe sciatica on the left side. Horrible, unbearable pain and very debilitating. Can I just say....WOW. I'm impressed. Best investment I have EVER made. I never would have thought that this unit could provide the relief of my pain, but in just 2 short weeks, I no longer need my cane and can actually work full days again.
Thank you so much for such an incredible product. And this price is just mind blowing. I've recommended this site to several people, with a 10 star review."	TENS 3000 3 Mode Analog TENS Unit with Timer	https://www.tenspros.com/

My wife was burned severely as a child and has extensive burn damage to the nerves in both legs, mainly her feet, the Tens which is used daily has been the only therapy that has provided her with any relief from the constant pain and discomfort associated with the burns.

871	Liz	Ohio	12/03/2014	4	?	I was very satisfied with this product. It did help relieve muscle tightness in my shoulders. I have a chronic back problem which causes leg pain but it didn't help that, but so far nothing has, so I don't count that as a negative. If you buy it, buy some additional pads as they lose their stickiness due to the oils in your skin and from handling them. Mine still work but are much less sticky.

This small unit does everything a big one does and it works GREAT! Takes all the pain away and I wear it probably more then I should, but it feels so good! I know not everybody likes tens units, but find a doc or a friend that might let you try one before you buy it, but I LOVE the new one I just bought, Best deal in town!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

875	Sandra	Atlanta	11/08/2014	5	TENS helps	This was my second unit--I upgraded to a newer model. It's excellent for that chronic, nagging pain in the lower back. Even with exercises I've found that the changes of osteoporosis and a continued active lifestyle create stiffness and tight muscles, restricting movement.

We bought three of the tens 3000 along with extra pads. We love them. We gave one to our son to use and one to my sister-in-law. We are going to order more of the tens units and extra pads.

881	Janice Eastwood	Jerome, Idaho	08/19/2014	5	Retired	"I had 3 vertebrae fused and a metal brace installed on my spine but after a few months, arthritis set in. The pain was intense and the shots that the Dr. gave me stopped working so they told me no point in continuing.
I tried every OTC patch,ointment,rub
that I could find. My regular dr gave
me morphine. I heard about TENS and it has worked so well that I stopped all of the meds! The unit is a GODSEND! Not only does it work perfectly, but it has paid for itself several times over! I have referred
three other customers to you."	TENS 3000 3 Mode Analog TENS Unit with Timer	https://www.tenspros.com/

883	Marsha K	Central FL	08/10/2014	5	Amazing TENS	"The #3000 TENS has been absolutely fantastic! It has helped me so much (healing bone, relieving low back and stiff neck pain) that I bought one for each of my brothers and have turned several friends onto it.
One brother had shoulder surgery. They used a TENS on him in PT. When he told the Therapist he had a home unit he was told to use it daily.
It saved one friend from back surgery and allows another friend who had badly done ankle surgery to walk w/o pain. I cannot say enough good things about it."	TENS 3000 3 Mode Analog TENS Unit with Timer	https://www.tenspros.com/

It lasts a good long while, after many uses. I'd say better than the ones that came with my Tens originally. But yes, VERY STICKY. With that in mind, gotta be careful that you don't damage them when removing. At first they can leave behind on your skin the sticky gel, but it's not a big deal. I'd rather then be this sticky and last than them not . Would highly recommend.	2'' x 2'' Premium White Cloth Electrodes - 4/pack	https://www.tenspros.com/

975	Anna Critney	Indiana	05/08/2020	5	Self	I am very happy with my new tens pads. They are very adhesive and stay so after multiple uses. I use my tens unit regularly and have used a lot of variety of pads, so far these would be my choice. I will definitely be reordering this pad again when I am in the need for more. I have used other pads that would leave the adhesive peeling off and stuck to your skin or on pillows or they did not stay adhesive very long and would have to throw them away after a couple of uses. Thanks for a great product, TENS Pro and well worth the cost!	2'' x 2'' Premium White Cloth Electrodes - 4/pack	https://www.tenspros.com/

989	Jean Gliottone	Roswell, NM	06/12/2019	5	Ms.	When I first started using my TensPro device almost 10 years ago, there was another style elctro pads that came with it, and that I ordered for several years. They were more expensive, lasted longer but didn't stick as well. This new (to me) style is very cost friendly, sticks GREAT, but needs to be changed out after 4 or 5 uses. And that would probably depend on each persons skin type, i.e. oily or dry. always make sure the skin surface is clean and dry. These are very good for their price. I've order enough for about 6 months with my last order. You won't be disappointed.	2'' x 2'' Premium White Cloth Electrodes - 4/pack	https://www.tenspros.com/

1194	Elaine	HAGERSTOWN	05/18/2016	3	Satisfied	"The pads were shipped to me quicker than I expected and I appreciated that since I needed them right away. They work well enough but I find that when I place them on some areas of my neck and/or back the TNS ""vibration"" is more of a sharp, piercing sensation that is quite unpleasant. If I turn my unit up higher, the piercing goes away but then the ""vibration"" is more than my muscles are ready for and they'll begin to spasm. So, I have to keep moving the pads to find a spot where that doesn't happen and it's pretty frustrating. I mention this only because I've never had this issue with other pads; however, I can't be certain that it's the pads. It might be me and my particular injury. Fortunately, the pads are priced so that it's worth it to give them a try."	2'' x 2'' Premium White Cloth Electrodes - 4/pack	https://www.tenspros.com/

I absolutely REQUIRE TENS machines and pads, so I looked online and found your company. I am using one of your machines right now with the Prmium Electrode pads as I write this. They work well.

These also only were adherent about half as long as those used at PT. They were however similar in working performance. I will be shopping around to see which product has longer adhesiveness. A TENS unit can only work properly if the pads adhere adequately. I do have to add that the first 2 uses the stickiness of the pads was crazy sticky.	2'' x 2'' Premium White Cloth Electrodes - 4/pack	https://www.tenspros.com/

I experienced a bulging disc in my lower back 4 years ago and occassionaly I get discomfort, throbbing pain, and the best way to relieve the pain is to use my Tens Unit.

1289	Carolyn Loxley	Ohio	07/24/2015	5	Ms	I bought these in the 50 pack and am very pleased. We rely on our TENS units to keep our old joints mobile as we do heavy work around the farm. TENS is the very best thing I have found to bring comfort to aching muscles and these pads do the trick. They are sturdy and I use them several time (only on me) before they lose their function. Pairing them with the gel really extends their useful life. Could not be more pleased unless they could put themselves on and take themselves off..... ;-)	2'' x 2'' Premium White Cloth Electrodes - 4/pack	https://www.tenspros.com/

1300	Sue Hord	Redmond	06/11/2015	5	Project Manager	The TENs machine has been a life saver for me. I injured my knee and have been going through Physical Therapy for 5 months if I didn't use the TENS machine and the pads that are great from the company rather then just a medical supply company, I would have been addicted to pills and probably not be able to walk. But the Tens machine makes it so I can do my Physical Therapy at home and then have the relief I need afterwards without taking pain medications.

This is very comparable to the unit that they use on me in the office and I love it. I do feel like it loosens up the muscles a bit and does help relieve some pain for short periods of time.

1405	Robert Johnson	KomieKalifornia	07/12/2023	5	TSgt USAF Retired	Purchased Two(2) of these TENS units. They are virtually identical to the LG TENS I bought 11 years ago on Amazon for 3 times the cost. The program screen is identical as is the 10 pre-set freqs and the case is identical. I also like the fact that they have a removable battery and DC power. My present LG has performed perfect-ally for over 11 years. When I went to Amazon I some how ended up being directed to the TENSpros web site. Liked what I saw and made the first purchase. Friend of mine saw the my new TENS and wanted to try it on her newly injured knee. Her reaction was that she immediately ordered he own and of course from TENSpros. I gave her my new TENS to use till hers arrived as she (Tina) was in a lot of discomfort. I then decided to order second unit as I do not ever want to be with out one. The delivery from TENSpros is swift and their web site is really easy to navigate. Overall give them 5+++ rating.

I attended a trade show a month ago where a vendor allowed me to try a TENS unit. Her price was completely outrageous for an unnamed unit with an unnamed manufacturer. After returning home, I did my research and found this unit as higly-recommended. Delivery was quick, price was good, and the unit delivered a painfree solution to my shoulder pain. Now I only need to use it every one to two weeks to keep the pain abated. Thank you!	InTENSity 10 Digital TENS Unit With 10 Pre-Set Body Part Treatment Programs	https://www.tenspros.com/

Thank you so much, I could not have been able to work without your unit! I used it every night and woke with either no pain or greatly reduced pain. I did not have to take any days off and was able to use it during my lunch break. Than you so much, taking off from work for any reason is greatly frowned upon.

1428	kat	ALBUQUERQUE	03/04/2022	5	Ms	What a great device! So reasonably priced, that it's the 4th one I've purchased. I loaned it to a friend who was in pain, it helped so much that I let him keep it. Then he told his buddy, who got the next one. My sister got the third one. I'm keeping this one a secret.

1430	Chris	Philadelphia	01/15/2022	5	Genuinely works! (Read if researching)	I took a chance and bought the InTENSity 10 for my fiancé (“A”), a nurse in her mid 20s with chronic muscular pain in one shoulder and occasional lower back pain after a day’s work. I have to say, I was skeptical, but she loves this thing. I haven’t used it, but A describes the feeling as that of someone gently “poking” and releasing over your muscle, massaging it out. The first time we tried the TENS unit, A’s range of motion without pain in her arm was better than it had been in months. The feeling persists for her for a few days, so we’ve been using the unit roughly twice per week. We keep the settings as low as we can, just in case she starts to build a tolerance for the machine (also, too high is uncomfortable). A describes the sessions as extremely relaxing, and has fallen asleep once or twice. (I was pretty anxious at first about leaving it running, and at first I always made sure I was around in case something went wrong, but at this point we’re both comfortable with it.) A also has very sensitive skin, and I was nervous that the sticky electrode pads would bother her, but they absolutely don’t. We’ve only been using the TENS unit for a month or so, so I can’t speak to the mid- to long term, but so far we’re blown away. I hope you or your loved one get the same comfort from this as we do!

1438	Tim	St. Louis	08/28/2021	5	Really good TENS unit	"The unit is really good and strong. The original battery was used up very quickly but I needed to use it 4 or 5 times a day at first. The AC Adapter solved that problem though.
The beeping on the button presses is very high and shrill, so be prepared for that."	InTENSity 10 Digital TENS Unit With 10 Pre-Set Body Part Treatment Programs	https://www.tenspros.com/

My therapist let me borrow there’s to see how it worked for me. I loved it .so I bought one for myself. I loved it. It really helps with the pain and you can use it on 10 different body parts. Also the price is very reasonable. I have a lot of orthopedic issues so it was well worth the purchase. Shipping was very fast. I got mine in less than a week. I highly recommend this product.

1445	Dr Jewels	Lexington	06/03/2021	5	DC	I love these TENS units. It is simple to show the patients how to use it with the pictures on the monitor. I have used other TENS units before; but this one is a no Brainer. The patient choses the area that is injured and presses start. No more having to set the settings for them. It is a wonderful product!!	InTENSity 10 Digital TENS Unit With 10 Pre-Set Body Part Treatment Programs	https://www.tenspros.com/
1446	Cindy	Westford	05/31/2021	4	Mrs	Love this unit!! It worked great on my shoulder and neck. I had hurt my shoulder a few yrs ago and had a cortisone shot in it. My shoulder started bothering me again and wanted to try the tense unit on it. It took the pain away after 4 uses. The only thing I didn't know that the battery that came with it was not rechargeable. So I suggest you get the rechargeable battery and the charger.

1448	Ryan	O'fallon, MO	03/10/2021	5	Intensity 10	The unit was awesome. Much better than cheaper AND way MORE EXPENSIVE units. Customer service went way above and beyond. They actually let me pick up the unit up in person, because I was in such extreme pain, and in the local area. My only advice for people with back issues would be to buy the bigger pads, like I did from the start. They are really cheap and help a lot more than the standard 2x2 that come with the unit. I will be forever grateful and I just recommended them to a family member. Can't beat the price and quality. Thank you again for all those that helped.

1449	Mandy	Midwest	03/06/2021	4	Ms.	"Pros: Incredibly helpful device and a great price compared to everything I've tried for pain management. Lightweight device. Excellent device for brain distraction with pain when present. Connects to larger patches without changing settings. Very easy to use. Able to use ""low back"" setting for lower abdominal pain since I deal with pelvic pain issues (PT taught me this). Can alternate with lower back placement to prevent skin irritation.
Cons: Wish the blue light would turn off faster. The beeping cannot be silenced so it's incredibly distracting in church and other places where quiet is preferred and little children are very curious about ""my toy"". The screen lock does not turn off manually but have to wait for the function to turn it off so don't press a button by accident until then.
Learning curve: Make sure the device is completely turned off prior to removing the patches or be ready for a vibrating/shocking surprise! :) It doesn't hurt but grabs your attention quickly!"	InTENSity 10 Digital TENS Unit With 10 Pre-Set Body Part Treatment Programs	https://www.tenspros.com/

The small, light-weight unit has multiple settings from neck to feet and plenty of intensity levels to satisfy anyone. I can’t believe it was under $50. I would recommend this product to anyone suffering. You can set the time from 15 minutes to an hour or continuous relief until you decide to stop. The unit will clip right onto your pants making mobility no problem. Also try the pain relief roll on. I’ve tried numerous products and this one actually works for me. Thank you TENSpros!

1461	Carmen	Humble, TX	09/30/2020	5	Retired	I bought the InTENSity 10 unit to help with the pain in my lower back. It seems to go out from time to time and when I go to the chiropractor, they use a similar unit on me to relieve the pain. Well, I finally did some research to see if I could find a machine like what they use for a home use instead. Sure enough, I found this unit and after receiving it, I use it a couple of times each month. I haven't felt this good (in my back) in a long time. So glad I found it online and purchased it from TENSpro. Thank you for shipping so quickly and stocking such quality products.

1462	Lucille	Indiana	09/30/2020	4	Ms	"The case is nice to keep all things together.
I used once on my knee and it worked fine. I went to use today, about 2 weeks after first use, and the battery was dead already. I plugged it in and it powered up.
I have a different TENS unit I have used for years and think it is wearing out, so thought this might be more powerful and is what my PT uses. Have to say the electrodes are kind of a pain as they are so sticky I can hardly get to release from storage plastic and body after use. I understand needing a good connection, but I end up having to clean my hands off of goo before I can use those fingers to touch power pack. I can see why the electrodes are good only for a few uses, as the some of the goo comes off after each use.
Looked at placement guide which is nice, but apparently I must not be placing correctly for my ankle (tried a couple different placements) as I could not get the unit to begin
I will update my rating after I have used more so it will be a more fair rating."	InTENSity 10 Digital TENS Unit With 10 Pre-Set Body Part Treatment Programs	https://www.tenspros.com/

1497	Rev. G	Clinton twp, mi	03/20/2020	5	Works great for me	"The belt clip makes this very handy. It does everything I could expect from it, and the electrodes last quite a while if cared for. I bought extras and have not used them yet.
This does a great job of relieving nerve pain. Having four electrodes let’s me place two on the lower back and two on the affected area of the leg.
One thing that could be better is if the two sets of electrodes could be set for two different body areas, but hey, this is a 40$ unit. I am more than satisfied. I would recommend it to anyone, better than the drug store units. I tried then first. And the shipping was ultra fast as well."

1498	Charles Green	GrandJunction	03/08/2020	5	Mr.	I like the ease of use and setup. It works very well in relieving the pain in my back after doing my exercises. It is well worth the price.

1501	(Verified Buyer) Zeek	Sumter, FL	02/12/2020	5		I bought this for a rotator cuff problem after having a TENS used on me during physical therapy. This works great! Plenty of zap power in a little unit. The Post Office thugs delivered mine with the case broken from their careless handling as usual. Tenspros replaced the case for free :)	InTENSity 10 Digital TENS Unit With 10 Pre-Set Body Part Treatment Programs	https://www.tenspros.com/

1503	Gary	USA	01/28/2020	4	Mr.	The reason for 4 stars and not 5 was because my TENS case was severely damaged during delivery. On the other hand I am impressed that the unit did come with a carry case at all and the unit was protected. The unit itself has power to spare and knocked out back pain in one session. I feel bad that I had previously purchased a slightly lower priced unit at the local drug store. They were under powered toys compared to this one. The pad connectors are compatible with standard TENS pads compared to the proprietary connections of the above mentioned 'toys'.

1525	John	MS	09/25/2019	4	Works great	This unit is plenty strong enough. Much stronger than the icy hot smart relief. It can get a little uncomfortable going past half power. The only thing I wish it did is to pulsate like the icy hot unit. I was hoping for a setting that works like a massage. The only thing the settings do is fade the intensity in and out. The setting for lower back is best, but it's more like a quick 'buzzing' feeling. It did relieve and help heal the lower ligaments in my back. Like I said, the only disappointment is the variance between the settings.	InTENSity 10 Digital TENS Unit With 10 Pre-Set Body Part Treatment Programs	https://www.tenspros.com/

1543	Deanna	PETOSKEY	05/22/2019	5	customer	Recommended by my physical therapist who has often used a professional in-facility devise on me over my years of visits. This unit quickly became easier to use - just figuring out where I needed and how to place electrodes. Only used four times (arrived while I was away for several days). I do mid-back following an X diagram with center over pain area. Relieves pain at that spot quickly. I have learned to meditate - sitting cross-legged on a floor pillow - during time.

1553	Donald Ring	Florida	03/31/2019	3	Mr.	"OK, but not as expected. Don't really care for the pulsing action. Would rather have a steady massage. Can set the desired area (neck, back, etc), but no way to automatically save the rate of massage you want upon selection. The intensity has to be set each time you turn on.
I hesitated about buying more expensive model, but wish I had spent more. However, the unit does the job, and I guess that is all that matters."	InTENSity 10 Digital TENS Unit With 10 Pre-Set Body Part Treatment Programs	https://www.tenspros.com/

1575	Kathleen French	Louisiana	10/26/2018	5	Product is so good, this is 2nd purchase	The TENS unit is amazing. I am a RN and a few years ago I injured my shoulder pulling up patients in bed. I went to Physical Therapy and after my exercises, they used a TENS unit on my to help control pain. I asked if they sold them but they did not but suggested I look online at THIS company. I did and bought my first TENS unit and loved it. My grown children often used it for minor aches and pains. They keep borrowing it so frequently that I decided I was purchasing another. If you have never used one to help control pain, talk with your doctor about one. I will not be without one. It is a great product. Highly recommended.

1580	Barbara	93422	09/30/2018	5	Self	Great little gadget. I had knee replacement surgery recently and the physical therapist used this after my session, so I decided to get one for home use. Whenever the knee acts up, I use it, and also used it on my arm when I strained a muscle. It is simple to use, and very effective. Probably is just as good as the higher priced models which easily run over $100. I love that it runs on electricity OR battery, making it easy to use anywhere. Probably the only change I would make would be a larger case, so that extra electrodes could be carried in it. Still, a 5 star item in my book.

1581	Theodore Justice	Manson	09/22/2018	5	Chairman	I have severe chronic lower back pain, the tens unit I was using eats batteries within a few hours of use. This unit is battery operated for mobile applications and best of all has a power adapter so you never have to worry about batteries while you are stationary. This unit offers several settings which provided relief to my back,neck and knees.This is the most awesome tens unit on the market today at a great price.

1583	Sharon Waldie	VA	09/01/2018	5	Homemaker	I have arthritis and tendinitis in my shoulder and elbow. At physical therapy this seemed to help and I wanted to be able to repeat this treatment at home. The Tens Pros is perfect for that. It’s easy to set up and instructions are clear. It’s battery operated , so no long electric cord to restrict you. It has numerous settings for different body parts that might need this type of therapy. I highly recommend the Tens Pro.

1584	Cindy	Wetumpka AL	08/26/2018	5	TENS Family	I recently purchased InTENSity10 for my freshman athlete grandson to take to college. I gave him my TENS3000 during this past baseball season. He shared it with his sister who plays soccer and runs cross country. His parents have also used the unit. I love my TENS7000 and use it often for sciatica, knee and shoulder pain. By using my TENS I don’t need to to take as much medicine for pain and sleep better. The size, along with the clip, easily allows me to take it anywhere with me.

1592	Cookie Grigware	Republic Wa	07/05/2018	4	Retired	I purchased the Tenspro 10,was super excited to get it, but was disappointed that it did not come with a rechargeable battery, and also should have come with a charger for the rechargeable battery. Had Empi for years, and it came with four rechargeable batteries, and a charger to keep a set always charged, so could use it portable for a long time. Other than that, do like the tens, and once I bought a set of rechargeable 9 volt batteries and a recharged, I am portable, but feel should have been part of the whole package. Cost me another $20.to get it the way I need it, portable for longer times.	InTENSity 10 Digital TENS Unit With 10 Pre-Set Body Part Treatment Programs	https://www.tenspros.com/

1598	Ricky	Kentucky	06/15/2018	5	Great Machine	I bought this unit a couple months ago and use it daily for chronic back/neck pain. I can only sleep on my back because any other way increases my pain level, so I'm able to plug it in by my bed, place the electrodes on my back and sleep with it in continuous mode all night. Using the unit all night has increased the quality and amount of sleep I get, decreased my nighttime pain level and keeps me from waking up stiff and hurting the next morning. Wearing it all night increases wear on pads and wires but is well worth the extra cost. I have also found that when the pads get so they don't want to stick well if you'll wash them good with a washcloth and rubbing alcohol it renews their stickiness and greatly increases their useful life. I'm getting about a month or more of use from one set of pads and I use my TENS device a lot.	InTENSity 10 Digital TENS Unit With 10 Pre-Set Body Part Treatment Programs	https://www.tenspros.com/

1621	G. Wells	lower back, and other parts due to RA	03/14/2018	5	Tens Unit	Unfortunately this device is not for me, as my pain is too severe! I've discovered that if I use it above 25 and for about 4-5 hours the battery is dead in 2 days. I even tried different 9 volt batteries, but it didn't matter. If you know of a device like the old Empi TENS I'd love to know. That was the only thing that helped my pain and the batteries lasted a lot longer!!! However, I must state this was a nice company to deal with. I just wish you had a better product for someone with RA.

This provides reliable and constant intensity level. I use on back and wrist. It reaches same intensity level as my chiropractors $$$$$$ TENS machine. I ordered extra pads to save on shipping later on down the road. The pads last 15-20 times of use. (Depends on how much hair, dirt, oil ...on skin) Very easy to use and the directions for use are good. Better than the unit being sold by my chiropractor and much more affordable.!!!

1655	Sarah	Geraldine	08/12/2017	4	None	The TENS unit works pretty good and has different levels depending on the parts of your body you use it on. My biggest problem with it and other units is there needs to be louder alarm or beep when it completes cycle. I have trouble hearing so if I'm preoccupied I don't notice it has quit. It doesn't completely shut off so it will go through batteries fast. The AC cord is good but it does limit your movement.

1662	Fawn Lovecchio	Ignacio, CO	07/05/2017	5	InTENSity 10 TENS unit	The InTENSity 10 TENS unit has been effective in helping reduce the pain and muscle spasms I suffer from in my low back and my neck. I have Cervical Dystonia (severe muscle spasms on one side of my neck that pulls my ear down to my shoulder constantly and is very painful). I tried BOTOX injections and muscle relaxers without any significant benefit. This TENS unit has relaxed my affected neck muscles enough so that my head is almost back up to a normal position and the pain is greatly reduced. And, unlike the above treatments I have received from Neurologists, it has had no side effects on me. I am very happy about the multiple site settings as I can use the low back and the neck.

1671	Barbara	Tennessee	03/24/2017	5	AMAZING COMPANY	I ordered the Intensity 10 tens unit after going to physical therapy and my therapist suggesting that It may help to have a tens unit at home. I always depend very much on reading reviews on everything I possibly can. This company and the reviews on this product was amazing, so I ordered one. I received the product and was surprised that it pretty much feels the same as the unit used at the therapy center. My only problem was the the power cord end that fits in the unit itself wasn't a tight fit. If I moved the unit it would come out . I understood why the reviews were so high after I called the company. I have never had a company step up to guarantee their product like this one. They immediately sent me a new unit. It is perfect. Thank you so very much for your quality product and amazing customer service.	InTENSity 10 Digital TENS Unit With 10 Pre-Set Body Part Treatment Programs	https://www.tenspros.com/

1709	Kevin	Street, MD	09/04/2016	5	Mr.	I was recommended the InTENSity 10 by my doctor. I was going 2x a week for physical therapy for pinched nerve between the shoulders. I had pain down my left arm and forearm. Each session started with heat and electrotherapy. I was also doing weight traction and cold / heat each evening at home. It took approximately 4 months to be completely relieved from the pain, I re-injured it 3 months later. This time my doctor recommended the TENS unit which I immediately purchased. I included it with my home therapy. Within 4 weeks the pain was gone. Now with even the slightest onset a couple days of home therapy and the pain is gone. So far no more Dr visits to squeeze into a busy work schedule. Great product. Thank you!	InTENSity 10 Digital TENS Unit With 10 Pre-Set Body Part Treatment Programs	https://www.tenspros.com/

1743	DJ	Arizona	02/25/2016	5	Ms	"After a virus attacked my heart, I was put on medication that prohibited the use of NSAIDS, etc. I hadn't realized how much I'd been depending on Advil until I couldn't use it. When my orthopedist looked at my knee X-rays, he said ""your knees are terrible."" The pain was inhibiting my ability to exercise and make progress in rehab. When I finally learned about TENS units, I did a lot of comparisons online, and chose this one. This device really helps mitigate the pain. The only drawbacks are the tendency of the pads to start peeling back when I'm sweaty, and managing the wires so I don't snag them and get that little buzz from a disconnect. The sensitive skin pads are a great help. I'd recommend this device."	InTENSity 10 Digital TENS Unit With 10 Pre-Set Body Part Treatment Programs	https://www.tenspros.com/

1745	Brian	SE Michigan	02/16/2016	5	End User	I would have to give this unit the highest rating simply because I can't think of any way to improve it. It's that great. It's small and compact, yet it packs all the bells and whistles of the larger machines that my physical therapist uses on me. After feeling the pain relief of his machine, I commented on how nice it would be if he left his machine at my house. It was then that he told me that I really could own my own machine. He was emphatic, however that this machine was the ONLY machine to consider. He claimed that many of his patients own this machine and they all love theirs. It's easy on the wallet at around $40.00 and it's so portable that you can carry the entire unit in your pocket. We use ours a lot. We even have friends that have tried ours and then purchased their own unit. It's just a great unit that provides a lot of relief.

1784	Tom	Ballwin Missouri	04/28/2015	5	Nice Product	"When I was almost finished with an exhausting 12 weeks of concentrated chemo, I was rewarded with peripheral neuropathy. My Doctors pretty much told me that I might start to feel some relief ""in maybe a year or so"". I realize that everyone has different healing rates and that some, like me will probably never get rid of the pain. I am not that crazy about the idea of being almost 5 years and the pain has only gotten worse. My Wife found a local Doctor who specialized in neuropathy treatment and pain relief. I went to him with a group of others who were as desperate as I was 3 times a week, 2 hours per stop for 14 weeks. They told us up front that there are no guarantees and no billing code for possible insurance help. Not the Doctors fault I guess but I spent $3,995.00 and got nothing in return. I was on two things that seemed to bring some relief, if only for a little while. one was the cold laser which I'm sure I could never afford and the other was electrotherapy which in that case was two electrodes dropped into the two compartments filled with water where your feet went. I ran into one of the fellows who was in that treatment with me while out Christmas shopping and he told me that he had found out about the TENS Pro equipment after he had given up on the therapy too. I was really surprised to find out how reasonably priced the units are and I placed my order for the number DI100-TA5013 and enough extra electrodes to last me a couple of years. I don't use it every night, I have times when the pain is too much. I do use it for 30 minutes on nights when I can. I have also put it on my Wife's lower back just to see if she could feel any relief, she said that she slept better that night than she had in a long time. I won't say it's a miracle cure all but for some of us any help is a big deal and it does seem to help."

1785	Lloyd McCown	West Chester, Ohio	04/22/2015	5	Retired	I purchased the TensPros to see if it could help with the pain I was feeling in my knee.

Tenspros while not completely eliminating my pain, lowers it to a very acceptable level and allows me to move about with a clear head and not nauseated.

1797	Marvin Roman	Martinsburg, WV	02/26/2015	5	Good Machine	Currently, A TENS muscle stimulator is used on me after taking rotator cuff therapy. I had decided I wanted to get one of these units. I initially looked on the internet for one that was exactly like the one used at my therapy facility, which cost about $900. I looked further, and decided on the InTENsity 10, because it has an AC adapter. The one I use at the facility is not designed with an adapter. It works just as well for me, as the one at my therapy facility, and I got the InTENsity 10 on sale for $39.95. Great bargain!!!

I couldn't belief how expensive it was! I then heard about this and found out that the exact make, model, everything the same was only about $45.00.

My settings did not match what was on the screen but she looked through the book and told me which one to use. She was also impressed they were careful enough to show the warnings about where not to use it in several places. This is a Quality machine and very portable as long as you are not plugging it in the wall. I am extremely pleased. Thank you Tens pros. If it ever needs replacing I will contact you again.

1837	Texasrich	San Antonio	08/25/2014	5	The right machine for the job	Years ago I suffered severe nerve damage in my lower back playing tennis. I dealt with the constant pain and rehabbed it slowly. Another recent injury to the same region brought back the big sharp unrelenting pain and sent me in search of relief. I freaking love this tens unit. It works for me. With walking, stretching and use of this product, I am feeling much better. If you deal with constant pain and just need relief from it then buy this product. I set it up and let it work. While it's working, it interrupts the pain. When the cycle is finished, it has taken the sharp edge of pain away for awhile. Buy it, you won't be sorry. No, they're not paying me for writing this. My doctor's recommendation for me was either surgery or constant medication. This unit gave me a third option. After a month of rehab, the pain is gone. Thank you for this wonderful product.

Love that I plug it in and do not have to pay for more batteries. Haven't even used batteries in it as of yet. My very active daughter (39) used mine for a neck problem and I have just ordered her a unit as it helped her so much. She had been going to a chiropractor, but got more results with the unit. My first unit was a Homepedic unit and I loved the charge it put out and the wonderful ""massage"" it gave, but the unit did not hold up and was expensive to use on a daily routine. This one has a lot of power and programmed for so many body areas. This unit works and depending upon your problem really can rid you of pain, soreness, ect.."

After my old unit died (The one I had to pay $700.00 for through insurance), This purchase was a leap of faith, I was not expecting it to be so AWESOME!! There are many different settings, but for me I have terrible severe back problems including back spasms. I was scared that this unit would not be strong enough but it is!! Actually it is stronger than my stupid old one that was so expensive! In Fact on my old unit, I was up in the 30s but on this one a lvl 18 is equivalent to lvl 32 on the old one. If you have back problems this is great buy! Plus you can see it in the dark! a feature the old one did not have. Worth the money times 10!!

1853	Jim Snyder	Cedar City, Utah	06/09/2014	4	Nice unit	This unit works very well. I've only tried it using batteries because it works just fine that way. I'm sure it will work just as well using the AC adapter. The only negative comment I have is that the body part icons are rather had to see. Other than that, it's an excellent unit.

1862	Eryn	Kansas	02/09/2014	3	Mixed feelings	I ordered this unit because it had the option to plug it in. It works very well when plugged in. BUT it's horrible with the 9v batteries. It only lasted about 4 hours each time. When I called to complain about the batteries, I was told that was about average. 9v are too expensive to burn through that quickly. Also, the power button doesn't require you to hold it down for a long time to turn it on or off, so there were several times that I bumped it and it turned on, further wasting the battery life. So if you only need to use this when plugged in, it's a fine unit. Otherwise, try something else.

1863	(Verified Buyer) Carly Cherenfant	Brooklyn, New York	02/05/2014	3	Not worth the hype	I bought this because I saw it on the Dr. Oz show. A friend also saw that episode & convinced me to buy it. All I can say is it's ok. I use it often & the relief is minimal. I started with 20mns to 30mns now I'm doing this for an hour at a time & still I'm in pain.

1864	Don	Lincoln, Maine	01/23/2014	5	Why did I wait so long to try this!!!	"After a fall almost a year ago breaking my wrist, elbow and bruising my shoulder I have been in constant pain 24/7. The bones healed but the pain remained. Over the counter pain meds were not working any more, and I didn't want to go the prescription route so I purchased this unit with a ""what do I have to lose"" attitude. All I can say is W-O-W!!!! After only 2 sessions I am sleeping through the night and not feeling the constant ache that I have experienced for the last year!!! I would, (and have!!), recomend this unit to anyone with cronic pain issues. I work at a hospital and have even shown it to our therapy department and they are impressed with my results thus far with this inexpensive unit!! I may even have to buy another one, as my wife and kids have started using it on their pains and strains and we are fighting for ""stim"" time!!"

As a last ditch effort, she started using the InTensity 10. She uses it every evening after a long day on her feet, & told me the other day, she was pain free for the first time in a very long time! I was ecstatic! This unit is a must have!"	InTENSity 10 Digital TENS Unit With 10 Pre-Set Body Part Treatment Programs	https://www.tenspros.com/
1866	(Verified Buyer) Rich dC	Long Beach, CA	01/21/2014	5	Instant Pain Relief	"I purchased this unit and had it for about one month. One thing to know about this unit and a lot of other units that TENS Pros sells, is that it has a beeping sound when you press the buttons and there is no way to mute this. SO this is not something you will bring to church and adjust while attending the sermon. Despite the beeping sounds, it has great modes to use which offer good relief of my pain.
I only had it for a month until I visited my Mother In Law who tried it and loved it too. Giving it to her has made me the best Son In Law EVER!!!! She loves that unit so much so that I gave it to her.
So I'm now in the market for another and will definitely order from TENS Pros AGAIN and AGAIN!!!
Did I mention that I'm also a Physician Assistant in Orthopedics and Pain Management? I have recommended many of my patients toward ordering from TENS Pros because of their great customer service!"

This is as powerful as the one my Chiropractor has. I like that I can place four pads in different areas and get treatment on more areas at one time. I suggest using the bigger pads instead of the ones that came with the kit. Great price, great product and it really works. Thank you so much for help with pain.

He was sent to get 3 steroid shots which cost a lot of money. After the third shot his doctor recommended a tens unit and lots of walking. Its been a year now and he just re injured back, he could barely move. We ordered the intensity 10 unit. He said this unit has so much more power then the one we had before. Its been 4 days and he is almost pain free. He is so young to be going through this but thank God for this unit. If you have any kind of pain I highly recommend this unit.

1879	Kurt	Grand Junction, CO	09/23/2013	3	well made unit but didn't relieve pain	"I purchased this unit for severe sciatica, inflammation of the large nerve which starts in the glute (butt) muscle and goes all the way to the toe.
I placed electrodes on my glute and my hamstring. Since those are the largest muscles in your body, they require a lot more current to be produce any stimulation.
After some experimentation, I found locations that worked fairly well. That is, I could feel the stimulation.
Did it reduce my pain? Not really. It did provide a distraction, but the pain was always there.
Here's some notes:
--all the settings are for joints, not muscles. I chose ""hip"" and my chiropractor thought that was the best choice.
--in the first two days, I received MAJOR shocks when I had the unit running at about 24 microamps and one of the electrodes came loose (such as lowering your shorts). The shock is similar to touching an electric fence: doesn't exactly ""hurt"" but is quite unpleasant. The instructions DO NOT WARN that this can happen.
I purchased a set of larger electrodes, which tended to stay in place better, but I was always nervous that I would get shocked again.
--After using it for several weeks, I developed an allergic reaction to the electrodes. I had visible red spots on my skin for many days, and they developed little blisters and itched for many days, forcing me to discontinue use altogether.
--There is no INSTANT OFF button. You have to press a ""Lower"" button, then hold the Power button for 4 seconds. Thus, if you are being shocked, you yank the cords out of the unit, which then beeps at you until you turn it off.
Bottom line: this unit might help different kinds of pain that do not require such large doses of current. For sciatica, it is quite inconvenient to apply the electrodes to your backside and make sure your underwear does not rub them off.
The unit is small, lightweight, and easy to attach to your belt. However, if you're running high current, the battery will die within a few hours, perhaps 4-5 hours. There is an AC cord which is fine if you are immobile, but if you leave your seat and unplug the power cord, the unit usually resets to zero: not convenient if you get up and down many times while the unit is in use.
Since it didn't relieve my pain and did carry the threat of severe shock, as well as causing allergic reaction, my conclusion is that it was not successful for me."	InTENSity 10 Digital TENS Unit With 10 Pre-Set Body Part Treatment Programs	https://www.tenspros.com/

The electrode pads I was using before were a little smaller, but these 2x2 really seem to disperse the sensation more evenly. My only complaint is that while they stick on so well and adhere to my skin very well, they are difficult to remove from the pad and from my skin because ot eh stickihness.

They are easy to clean and when they start to lose their stickiness all you have to do is spray them with a light spray of distilled water and they are as good as new. With this method I have been told that you can get as many as 30 uses before they need to be replaced. it is also important o make sure your skin is clean before applying the electrodes to maintain their life. There is a good video on YouTube on care and cleaning of electrodes that I recommend watching. Very happy with this product.

The only thing I don’t like about them is that when I have my unit up to where I need to have it, there is extra adhesive that is on the sides and it shocks me wrong. So I have to turn off my machine and take off the pad fix the adhesive and put it back on. Sometimes that works and sometimes it don’t. I would definitely recommend these!

2201	Patricia Keim	MEDINA	11/10/2023	5	None	This unit was recommended by the PT I am working with on a foot issue (2nd toe capsulitis and metatarsalagia). I got a PRP injection and the ultrasound is helping to break up previous scar tissue and also to get rid of inflammation. I use it ever day that I don't go to PT (where they ultrasound it). It's helping me heal. The unit is very easy to use!	US Pro 2000 2nd Edition Portable Ultrasound Therapy Device	https://www.tenspros.com/
2202	Bijan	Berkeley, CA	10/19/2023	5	Individual	"I highly recommend this ultrasound.
I was in pain and couldn’t play racquetball due to biceps distal. After applying twice a day for 2 days, and then once a day for 3 more days, I was clear from pain.
I have used it on my knee a few times also. Just love this device. Saved me time going to P/T. I have recommended to all my racquetball club..."	US Pro 2000 2nd Edition Portable Ultrasound Therapy Device	https://www.tenspros.com/
2203	Mary C.	Winterport, ME	10/14/2023	5	It works!	I purchased the unit to help me with the pain in my hands, Bone on bone in both wrists. It helped tremendously with the problem.

2210	Sieglinde	Buda	08/10/2023	5	US Pro 2000	I LOVE my machine!!! I use it every day, either on my hip that I injured a year ago or under my arm. I had a wound that was 20x8 centimeters big. The regular use of this machine has helped to break down the scar tissue and soften the areas around the wound. This is turn allowed the wound to shrink and at this point is almost closed. I am very happy that I have purchased the US Pro 2000.	US Pro 2000 2nd Edition Portable Ultrasound Therapy Device	https://www.tenspros.com/
2211	Sabrina	Laredo	07/24/2023	5	ms	This ultrasound wand is saving me (so far) from having to have knee surgery. It's so easy to use as long as i remember to have plenty of paper towels ready to clean the gel off my knee when I finish. It seems to keep my very arthritic knee in good working condition. The doctors tell me I need a knee replacement, but as long as I have this, I think I'll be 'good enough' to avoid it. I just bought another one for a friend of mine.

2223	Fernando	Round Rock	12/09/2022	3	Mr.	"Hard to tell if my health improvement comes from the product or the multi-disciplinary therapy approach but I feel it gives me the same results I had from ultrasound at PT.
Easy to use. Instructions are clear. Case is protective.
Downside: there's no sound alert. You need to keep looking at the device to know when it has warmed up and especially when the time cycle is completed. I don't think it would make the product much more expensive to include a beep. As simple as that. Also, when the time is over and you are still using the device it is hard to notice when the LED comes off. The lights are probably too close to each other that sometimes it's hard to tell which one is on unless you take the device off your skin and look at it from a specific angle."

I have calcification/tendonitis in my shoulder that I had been going to physical therapy for 1-2 times a week and the therapist would do a couple minutes of ultra sound on my shoulder before exercises. Got covid, stopped therapy for a couple months, and I regressed. I decided to order this on a whim, and started using it every day for 10 minutes on my shoulder. I healed more from just using this for 2 weeks every day than 2 months of physical therapy. Seriously, I was absolutely delighted. It works!

"I bought this unit after experiencing positive results with ultrasound in my occupational therapy after hand surgery for nerve repair after a bad cut. I ""graduated"" from therapy after a few months, and decided to get this to continue ultrasound therapy at home. Nerve recovery can continue for up to a year or more. I use it at least every other day and it makes a big difference in the swelling/inflammation/stiffness in my hand, which allows me to do my strength building exercises with less pain and quicker recovery. It's a quality piece of equipment and easy to use. I highly recommend this device!"	US Pro 2000 2nd Edition Portable Ultrasound Therapy Device	https://www.tenspros.com/

I have been INJURED by bad PTs who are either stupid and inexperienced, or just want to keep you in therapy to make money. As a personal trainer, I know the exercises. I just need the STUFF: the Ultrasound, and the Tens machine. Now I have both. YAY. I don't need to go to Physical Therapy EVER AGAIN.

I wish I had known about dound and scar before I spent $22000 at a clinic in Atlanta that gave me 0 zero improvement. When I wake and feel something not felt in a decade, I feel great about my choice in trying this. No it does not work in less than 5 minutes.

2268	Mike Stevens	Bellevue	08/22/2020	5	Human	I experienced a bad ankle sprain while hiking; recovery has been slow and pain level has been high. I bought this product to help spur the recovery and to treat my Achilles tendon, which has developed a knot in it over years of physical activity. I often have a lot of pain the next day after a big bike ride or a long hike, but I have gotten into the habit of using this machine on my ankle and I'm happy to report that it makes a BIG difference. Not only is the pain far less, but my ankle is more flexible the next day, as well. The knot in my Achilles has reduced in size. I have developed a routine where I sit on the floor and watch Netflix while I'm treating my ankle, and I actually look forward to it. I do the treatment almost every day. I am happy with the product; it's not a miracle cure, but it works. I've been using it for about 3 weeks now, and it has made a difference for me. I've also used it on my elbow to treat tendonitis, and it helps. The product construction is very good quality, and is easily worth the price. I recommend it to friends.

2282	Debbie	Michigan	02/08/2020	5	Very Happy with unit	I recently purchased the US Pro 2000 2nd Edition Portable Ultrasound with Continuous Pulse & Pre-Warming Soundhead after having OT for arthritis pain and stiffness and synovitis in my hands/fingers. Of all the things the therapist tried, the ultrasound gave me the most relief. I'll never be rid of the pain, (surgery won't even guarantee that), but at least I know I can get some relief before I go to bed at night and it seems to last until the next evening. Sometimes I can do a treatment every other night. Anyway, it greatly helps me. I also bought the bigger bottle of the gel and I haven't even opened it yet,,,still working on the tube sent with the unit.

They are worried that everything is fine for you. In my case, I needed this before my trip, so I was so worried about the delivery, but they did not hesitate to contact me and help me with this.

2304	SUE	NEW RIVER	02/23/2019	5	Ms	"I am very pleased with this product. I suffer from carpal tunnel syndrome and purchased this unit with hopes it could provide some relief from the painful symptoms. I have not been disappointed. The first time I used it I was able to sleep without wearing either of my splints. I have only used it three times. It""s been about 2 weeks since I used it last and am still pain free during the day but pain is returning at night so I am planning to use it again today. So far this product has exceeded my expectations. I probably need to use it once a week to continue maintaining on-going relief. The only con I have is: (and really not worth mentioning -but wanted to include something negative just to be fair. LOL) the insert that holds the unit inside the carrying case pops loose every time I remove the unit. But I can pop it right back in. Doesn't affect the units function."

I do not like the gel, it dries out and gets tacky too quickly and doesn't allow the unit to work.

2316	Cliff	South Florida	10/17/2018	5	medical professional, retired	I selected this product to provide sonic therapy for two conditions: 1) plantar fasciitis for my wife and 2) a mediopatellar plica for myself. The results for my wife are still in process but relief is slowly taking place. My condition had me on crutches, NSAID's and ice packs. The weekly sonication brought instant relief and after four weeks of therapy, I am pain-free, off crutches, drugs and packs. The prognosis for me was quite limited and moving forward, the orthopod did not even suggest this modality. The ability to vary time and intensity on this device is extremely beneficial in working up to a useable setting. I strongly recommend the US Pro 2000 for cases requiring deeper penetration than topical applications can provide. It is cost effective, easy to use and palliative. A note of caution: Do your homework when using this device relative to it's settings. Know what the target settings are in the literature for your particular condition before using. The Low, Medium, High settings equate out to 0.083, 0.8 and 1.8 mJ/mm^2, respectively. If you're uncertain on the power settings and durations, ask your clinician. Good luck.

2319	deborah	Bismarck	08/03/2018	4	US PRO 2000	This is the second unltrasound unit I have purchased from this company. The first one I used for years before it finally gave up. Since I have chronic pain, I decided to order another unit. I like this one a lot, it has great features, is easy to use and easy to clean. The only thing I was a bit disappointed in was the case. The second time opened the case, the whole inside liner on the top just fell out. Tried to glue it back but the results weren't very good. Wish the case had been a better quality, as I am hoping to use this for years to come but the case is not going to hold up. Good thing it doesn't affect the performance of the ultrasound unit itself.

2327	Loretta	Steamboat Springs	04/18/2018	5	RN	In the early 90s I used to perform ultrasound 15 minutes per area on all patients that the plastic surgeon liposuctioned. Portable machines have really changed and improved. This machine is spectacular. Our daughter was in a accident on the ski hill and had a huge hematoma that went down her leg and into her back. I ordered the ultrasound for her. She did the ultrasound beginning day 5 and the bruising was gone by day 15. Amazing. This machine is portable, warms, pulses and penetrates deep into the tissues. Great results. Usually a bruise takes 3 weeks to go away. The ultrasound expedites tissue healing.

2342	LMS	San Diego	12/02/2017	5	My Arthritic Finger is Much Better	I have arthritis in my finger, and when using an ultrasound on a small area, you need to use it under water to protect the head. Many home units do not have waterproof heads, this one does and it works very well. Don't dip the entire unit in the water!

2345	Vicky	Missouri	10/03/2017	4	OTR/L	I am an Occupational Therapist of 23 yrs and have used clinical ultrasound machines for many years to reduce contractures, which requires specific duty factor and w/cm2 in order to work. Lacking a machine at home for a family member with hamstring contractures, I risked some money on this device. At the specified preset closest to what I use for contractures, it worked fair. Not perfect but it did work to a lesser extent than it should at the stated calibration. I do not believe this sound head provides even coverage across the whole head as it should, but it's 1/10 of the cost of a clinical machine .

2353	MRE	California	07/13/2017	5	Huge help	I had a great deal of elbow pain (knitting, working at computer, other repetitive motions) and was having a hard time lifting things with that arm. After applying ultrasound with this machine on 3 separate days for 5 or 10 minutes each, my arm feels perfect and is back to functioning 100%. FYI I was also using an infrared massager and exercising it about since February (when the pain first started) and wasn't getting any improvement. I was not expecting such dramatic results with this ultrasound, so I was pretty amazed. I've had a number of injuries before where ultrasound was used as part of the PT, so was reasonably sure I would get some improvement, but a return to full function is something I've not had with any of my other complaints. Very happy with this purchase. Even if it broke tomorrow (which I hope it won't!!) it would still be cheaper than if I had gone to the doctor and the PT.

2357	Dee	NY	04/03/2017	5	LMT	As a licensed massage therapist and occupational therapist I have used US for my patients. I was skeptical about this unit for the price and effectiveness.

2358	Kelly L	Creston, BC	03/29/2017	4	User	I have only had the US Pro 2000 for a couple of weeks and so far so good. I have joint pain in my left thumb and I am also recovering from shoulder impingement. The product is easy to use and I am definitely getting results on my thumb. The shoulder is a bit more stubborn but is seems to be benefiting from treatments. Time will tell as long as the product lasts as long as it says it should.

2362	heather revesz	mesa, az	03/20/2017	4	director	This is the second one we have purchased and are happy with both but it would be more convenient to have the controls on the inside of the unit not the back. When you have to lift it up to look at and use the controls the gel slips off the head. The gel also gathers around the lip of the head so I am thinking the head should be smooth all the way across. Our first one was like that and was a better design.	US Pro 2000 2nd Edition Portable Ultrasound Therapy Device	https://www.tenspros.com/

2383	HappyME	Maine USA	07/20/2016	4	Very satisfied	I had surgery on both hands and had to work to reduce swelling and scar tissue; and also to regain as much function as possible. The US Pro 2000 2nd Edition was a huge help in my recovery. It's easy to use and to keep clean and, most importantly, it feels very good on my hands whilst I'm using it. I use the supplied gel but I mix it with cream for a stiffer product which runs less. I had used an earlier version and it was okay but this is much better. I recommend it.

2394	CB Oliver	Houston TX	02/26/2016	5	individual	This portable ultrasound machine is everything that I read in previous reviews, and I have been recommending it to many of my friends lately. It is unbelievably compact, warms up quickly, and does a great job of relaxing my knotted muscles and of getting the blood flowing again. Because it has a 1.0 MHZ acoustic frequency, it is the same strength of the machines at PT and chiropractic practices, which is important to me. I bought it because I was having a problem with my shoulder, and now I am using it for hip flexor muscle spasms. Whereas it does not cure my problems, it definitely makes me more comfortable without taking any medications, which could have bad side effects.

I AM VERY HAPPY WITH THIS PURCHASE	US Pro 2000 2nd Edition Portable Ultrasound Therapy Device	https://www.tenspros.com/
2396	Bob	Norfolk	02/12/2016	5	I say it works	This device appears to work very well on reducing pain & inflammation on recent or ongoing (chronic)injuries. For example, I'm having my left knee replaced one week from now. I began using the ultrasound some months before, and it improved my condition so much that I began to question if I had been a hypochondriac with my knee problems, and so I started riding bike again after about a year of being unable to ride at all. After a couple months and many 20 mile rides, it became obvious that my knee really was bone on bone after all, and there was no alternative to a knee replacement. That just shows, I think, that this device is clearly remarkable in its ability to reduce pain & inflammation and allow one to resume a rather normal life. It can't, however, cure a worn out joint, but it's really effective at helping you get by with one I highly recommend it.

2397	Mike	Moneta, VA	02/09/2016	5	Tennis Coach	I haven't used this unit as much as I expected but it is a very nice unit, well made and apparently as effective as much more expensive units. The original unit could have had a bit more gel as the small bottle hardly lasted long, so if you are ordering one, order an extra bottle or two of gel. Learn how to use the unit as there are different depth settings.	US Pro 2000 2nd Edition Portable Ultrasound Therapy Device	https://www.tenspros.com/

2405	Jj Lewicki	FL	10/15/2015	5	RN, Case Manager	The price is right. It's all worth it. When applied to the hands do be careful not to over extend the time.

2415	David	Maryland	10/25/2014	5	As advertised	I have to admit that I was a bit skeptical when placing my order. But I can honestly say that my skepticism was completely unwarranted. I'm using US to facilitate the healing process for an injured tendon (inner-elbow just above the elbow joint). After a couple months of daily treatment, I'm about 90% healed. I should also mention that I ordered a medicated gel from another vendor, which may be a contributing factor in the healing process. Not sure, but with its aromatic and cooling effect it certainly leaves me with that impression. This device feels of sound quality and performs as advertised. However, I should add that this is the only device I've ever used, so my opinion should be read in that context. Five stars!

2417	Wayne	Hawaii	08/18/2014	4	Great Item	Purchased and been using it for about a month now. I have used the unit on all 3 settings and noticed a physiological change in the area I use it on. You have to keep it motion as when you leave it in a spot for a short period of time, the area begins to feel like when you hit your funny bone. It definitely floods the area with blood but repair is done in conjunction with your diet. I supplement with Collagen and Glucosamine.

2418	Kris	White Salmon	08/18/2023	5	Ms	I especially like the convenient carrying case and how easy the unit is to use.

2427	Lasi Leavy	Pennsylvania	01/10/2022	5	Ms.	I bought my Intensity Select Combo unit in 2017. It's still going strong. It's been passed around the family at times, so this past Christmas, 2021, I bought one for each of my three daughters. They were thrilled to receive one. I love this little powerhouse unit. I highly recommend it .	InTENSity Select Combo TENS, EMS, IF, & Microcurrent Unit + Free A/C Power Adapter Included	https://www.tenspros.com/
2428	Dean	USA	12/03/2021	3	consumer	"Okay some basics: this is a great unit if you're looking for 100% customization over every possible setting imaginable. Intensity, timing, ramp up times, etc. It has endless options for customization to find the program that works just right for you and your injury.
If this is your 1st TENS unit, you may be overwhelmed by the sheer customization options. There's definitely lingo that you need to familiarize yourself 1st. I recommend reading the instructions more than once and maybe working with your chiropractor or physical therapist for recommendations on placement and setting. (Getting the optimal electrode placement and setting is CRUCIAL to getting the best recovery outcome. This requires some trial & error, googling for tips, etc.)
Now back to the unit, it comes in a cool carrying case with everything you need to get started. Pads are sticky, wires work well, and the unit is easy to setup.
CON: battery. This unit absolutely destroys batteries. I think that is the only con. I unpacked a brand new 9V battery and my unit drained it after two 60 minute IF sessions.
PRO: I bought the unit with the AC adapter and that means I do not need to use batteries.
CON: If you are using the AC adapter, you cannot move around with the unit since you are essentially tethered to the wall. This may not be a con if you're not planning on moving around, but if you are used to wearing your unit while doing chores/being mobile, then this will not work for you.
PRO: If you have an injury where you don't plan on doing much moving around, the AC adapter add-on will be great for you since you will never need batteries. Again, decide what is right for you because yes, this unit absolutely destroys 9V batteries.
MISC:
- there's a beep sound when cycling menu options. This isn't too loud and it doesn't bother me or anyone else in my household.
- time: you can customize your time from 1 minute to 60 minutes, and even set it to run continuously until you manually turn it off. Very cool feature.
Final recommendation: I do recommend this unit. Don't be overwhelmed by the options and settings. Reach out to others. Talk to your chiro or PT. The only downside is the battery issue. The AC adapter overcomes this, but only if you don't mind not being able to walk around while using this unit."

2430	Joan	Franklin, WI	07/30/2021	5	Mrs.	I've used the combo TENS about 3 times so far. it works nicely! It was a bit tricky sticking electrodes on my back by myself, but even if they aren't exactly where you want them, they work well. It would be nice to have a few extra electrodes, so I can share my unit with another person. I may have to get some more. :)	InTENSity Select Combo TENS, EMS, IF, & Microcurrent Unit + Free A/C Power Adapter Included	https://www.tenspros.com/
2431	Michael	PA	07/04/2021	5	Useful Unit	This is a well made unit, easy to use after figuring out the instructions. I use the TENS and EMS modules for about an hour a day. I choose to use the battery rather than the adapter and, unfortunately, have found I have used three batteries in four weeks. However, that is a minor inconvenience for me and it does the job that I purchased it for. As a side note, I suggest that you purchase extra electrode pads.

2437	HEATHER F	Milford	03/25/2021	5	LOVE IT....BUT...	"Is there a ""TENS for Dummies"" book? I LOOOOVE this product....BUT the technical lingo is HARD to interpret. I just had a Total knee replacement...""typically"" (i.e. in PT) I would use the IF, EMS and Microcurrent. I use IF and EMS at PT. I know the other frequencies are beneficial, I just don't know HOW. For example, with IF the electrodes need to be criss-cross. I've read with Microcurrent, you need a special LOW frequency electrode which doesn't come with the unit. That being said, if there was a ""dumb it down"" set of instructions for the technically challenged....It would be PERFECT. Like, where do I place the electrodes for which modes? I've watched countless YouTube videos and most likely will bring the unit with me to PT to have my therapist explain what the best settings are for me. That being said, I do find this unit to be effective in the minimal capacity I've used it, I just would LOVE to use it to its full capacity!"

2446	Brian	Silver Spring, MD	01/23/2021	5	Works As Shown	I purchased this for my wife's migraines because of the different settings. It took some effort to understand how the unit operated, but once I figured it out it is pretty easy to use. I went on Youtube to help with understanding how to use the unit and our Doctor to get the right settings. We have used the unit for other issues such as sore shoulder, inured back, etc. I has made a difference in getting over these aches and pains without always resorting to pain medications. Great unit for the price and the many different program options if you don't want a unit that just has fixed settings. I purchased some rechargeable batteries and charger as well since it went through the alkaline battery pretty quick. We try to use it with the A/C adapter as much as possible.

2447	Eric P.	Goffstown	01/16/2021	5	Affordable Relief	"The unit probably does a lot more than I use it for (like most tech I own). After 2 back surgeries, 4 knee surgeries and a thumb surgery I have been a regular at RE physical therapy office for the last three years. $25 dollars twice a week, sometimes three times for 20 minutes of exercises I can do at home and 30 minutes on their tens/IR machine.
I have had no battery issues or complications with the machine."	InTENSity Select Combo TENS, EMS, IF, & Microcurrent Unit + Free A/C Power Adapter Included	https://www.tenspros.com/

My wife started going to physical therapy for her shoulder and the therapist suggested this unit for home use. There is a little learning curve in figuring out how the unit works. We had read the instructions several times and use the device a few times to really understand what settings work best. Once we learned our way around the controller, found it works great and provides relief.

I get severe muscle spasms and this helps SO much! I absolutely suggest it to anyone looking to purchase a TENS unit. Super easy application, but also very secure when placed on!

I definitely suggest purchasing an add on with extra electrodes, at the very least just to be sure you have them."	InTENSity Select Combo TENS, EMS, IF, & Microcurrent Unit + Free A/C Power Adapter Included	https://www.tenspros.com/
2451	Robin Triplett	Morganton	12/09/2020	5	Good investment for pain management	I got this for my wife for Pre-Surgery back pain. It has worked very well and gives her temporary relief.

I thought this was an upgrade from the one I had bought from here a few years ago. Although I did give it a tray and the results speak for themselves. It is a great unit, works as expected (or better) and definitely worth the purchase. I do wish it were rechargeable as I hate buying new batteries. (Not good for the environment) but it works flawlessly. And when I have a plug close by, the wall adapter works too.

2453	Joe cascio	Idaho	11/06/2020	4	Papa	Love the unit. The only problem is that battery times are not eluded to in the manual. I was frustrated when my therapist set the machine on IF and it only worked for about 40 to 45 minutes and then the battery was spent. I found the remedy on you tube.

2455	Sherri	Maryland Heights	10/17/2020	5	Mrs.	"I ordered this product about 6 weeks ago. I mainly purchased this for my husband who has chronic knee pain and he has used it sporadically with good results. I decided to use it also since I suffer from weekly migraines. I am a physical therapist and have used estim with my patients for many years but questioned how helpful it would be for migraines and how effective as a home unit compared to a larger clinical model. I used it daily for a week with mild improvement and continued to use it but increased to multiple times a day. I usually would need to use over the counter meds at least every 3 days. Today I used some for the first time in three weeks !!!! Plus with minor muscle aches I use it instead of reaching for any pain meds. My only regret is not ordering it sooner. I recommended this unit to a fellow therapist who has purchased one and also has found pain relief.
Great product and would shout it from the rooftops how this should be tried and put down the pain pills !!!!

CON: Battery life is short so I recommend using the AC adapter.
After placing on all the wires it is difficult to move around. Having said that, maybe they can come up with a bluetooth version to make it easier to move around. Also, it's a bit time consuming having to press the buttons to achieve your desired intensity level. A keypad or range button would be helpful in reaching those levels instead of pressing the button for each desired number or level of intensity.

2464	Audrey	Lexington, KY	05/20/2020	5	Better than I expected	A friend of mine loaned me this brand’s simpler unit that only has TENS and EMS and I’m glad I bought this product. The TENS is great for everyday neck pain for me but the other settings especially the IF is perfect for my serious more chronic pain Which leaves me with no range of motion in KY neck. Love the control it allows you but the presets make it easier when you’re first trying to figure it out. It doesn’t come with much instructions at all about how to calibrate the settings for use but I googled some videos on YouTube and learned pretty quickly. Overall great product.

2465	Trinity	Florida	05/15/2020	5	Best product of them all	I have purchased a small microcurrent unit from TENS Pros in the past. They are the only ones who I trust for quality products like this. I pulled my rotator cuff and desperately needed relief. This machine on the microcurrent setting made it so that I could actually stand the pain. I have been using it and it has been healing my tendinitis effectively. You can’t beat the price for this machine, it has four different modes. I like the microcurrent best since I am trying to heal an injury, IF is supposed to help too but I haven’t tried it yet. After going through the directions one time, it became very easy to use. It is especially great that I can control all kinds of settings on the microcurrent to achieve exactly the setting for my specific pain. I searched the Internet and came up with P3, 30ms pulse width, 5hz pulse rate, 30 sec cycle time (T). I've changed the hz up to 10 but find 5 works best. I leave it on continuous stim because I cannot stand the beeping noise when a cycle stops. I am up to .60 mA now, I started very low like .05. I turn it up until I start to feel a slight tingle. Note that on microcurrent you may not feel anything at all because it’s microcurrent, not like tens which stimulates your muscles. The more hydrated you are, the more likely you will feel the tingle. I put one pad on either side of the injury and each time I did a session, I moved them to different locations. Some locations worked better than others you just have to figure it out. When I was first injured, I did like 12 sessions a day. I am now and only doing one session for an hour or two while I watch TV before bed and it has been three weeks and my injury is feeling 80% better. Note when you were in continuous mode, in order to turn it off, you have to press the channel down button at least once and then it will allow you to press and hold the power button to turn it off. Thank you TENS Pros for an awesome product at a great price. Also the shipping was super fast which was great since I had an injury so I very much appreciated that I got it right away. I would buy this unit again and I also recommended it to all my friends.	InTENSity Select Combo TENS, EMS, IF, & Microcurrent Unit + Free A/C Power Adapter Included	https://www.tenspros.com/

Prior to this purchase, I did my research and spoke to my doctor, to see if he had any thoughts on IF. He encouraged me to try it. This unit far exceeded my expectations! It is definitely a step above the older style units. The IF mode has really raised the bar, in terms of pain control. Due to medication sensitivities, coupled with the fact that I work full-time, meds are not conducive to my lifestyle, but this unit affords me the pain control I need! I have referred others, also!

I bought this machine as a replacement for a TENS unit, to get the Interferential functionality. However, the MicroCurrent feature looks to be just as useful for my needs. Have been using TENS for 30+ years, on and off.
The Manual provides very little help in settings (in comparison to NeuroTrac unit I replaced), and gives little information on how to use. As Microcurrent pad placement differs from TENS/IF, much research was needed to be able to use effectively.

2480	Staci	Parker, CO	05/24/2019	5	Patient	I have been using a TENS unit I bought in a drugstore for a couple of months now for extreme lower back pain that began when I broke my spine several years ago. It is the only thing I have found that actually relieves my pain. Last weekend, I got a pretty bad migraine, and after reading a research study on migraines and TENS I decided to try the unit on the back of my neck, avoiding the spine, front, and side of neck (basically I placed the electrodes below the head on either side of the spine). I am dead serious when I say my migraine was gone in 30 min. Having found yet another use for electro-therapy, I decided to purchase this unit. I did a ton of research to find one that would allow me to use TENS, IF, and microcurrent. I really wanted to try microcurrent with ear clips, I wanted to try IF, and I wanted a device with electrode size options, a wall plug, and 2 channels. I have to tell you, I am very very pleased. I read some comments about how difficult this unit is to use. While it is not for the casual patient with limited knowledge of electro-therapy, if you have a good base knowledge of electricity, the goals of different electro-therapies, and/or the willingness/ability to do some research, this device might just be perfect for you. I can imagine without understanding how the different therapies work, this device would be very confusing. If you just want to try it, and don’t want to spend a lot of time learning and researching, you are probably better off with a simpler device. However, if you use these therapies like I do, in place of medication that you would otherwise require in order to function, this device truly has it all and is actually very user friendly and intuitive. Unfortunately I broke my foot and sprained my ankle 4 days ago, and I’m so glad I already had this on the way. I didn’t want to place it near my freshly broken bone without a doctors ok, so I asked my new orthopedist about it this morning, and he told me to go right ahead and use it. The result? Sweet, sweet relief. I am using the IF setting (please research proper electrode placement for this, as it requires a specific cross-cross patterns to work properly using the IF setting), and I am feeling so much relief. Just researching the benefits of these therapies I am totally blown away. I wish more people knew about this as an option, and as an alternative to opioids.

2484	steve	flagstaff	02/13/2019	4	IF mode works!	these units are fascinating to me and upon trying the IF, which as I understand it work at a deeper level in the tissues, worked in healing up a muscle pull.

2486	Marian Machman	San Antonio	01/25/2019	5	Ms	My physical recommended that I purchase this model. I had another TENS, IF unit before but it stopped working. I had also received IF treatments in the PT clinic that were temporarily helpful. This unit seems very similar to the unit in the PT clinic. I do get some temporary relief of my pain from this unit on both the IF and microcurrent settings. I understand that any unit like this does not take the pain away permanently. I would recommend this unit to help alleviate pain.	InTENSity Select Combo TENS, EMS, IF, & Microcurrent Unit + Free A/C Power Adapter Included	https://www.tenspros.com/

2490	Pyra	MO, USA	11/30/2018	4	Chic`n`charge	"Good lil unit. The directions are horrible for learning how to use all the features, so it forces you to play and experiment with settings. That can be fun at times, but when you need to get some relief, you want to just go to your 'workin' numbers' and not piddle with things of uncertain use.
The pads that came with this lasted 7 times.
Looking on Amazon at units that do same as this, I'd say the price is somewhat comparable. The only thing that will save TENSPROS from the Amazon cyber-monster is efficient and timely customer service. So far they have been helpful so +1 for TENSPROS.
For those who read reviews wondering ""should I buy this?"", I encourage you to do thorough investigation and shop around. Not all features are useful to everyone and not every fancy case has a fancy product inside."

The case material is sold and the battery holder is well made. My only suggestion would be to improve the owner's manual with more detailed instructions on how to set it up. I have spent my life authoring ""how to"" books, and I can say with some authority that it wouldn't be hard to improve the user manual. In any case, I highly recommend the unit!"

I am going to keep it but I probably will not use it for the issue I ordered it.

It takes a bit of reading to understand but the instruction booklet was thorough and quite helpful. Despite being small the unit is very powerful. My main concern in buying a home unit is that it wouldn't be powerful enough. The belt clip is convenient. It has a safety lock feature which was nice.

2546	Gloria	US	07/15/2016	5	Review	"I truly have to say it worked so well for me when I was in pain. I was using it an average of 5 to 6 hrs a day. I since feel a lot better and have only had to use it once or twice a week. I sure was a life saver when I was in such pain. It saved me trips to the chiropractor daily. My Chiropractor liked it so much that he had all the information for the unit and would tell his clients about it. In fact his wife bought him one for his birthday.

I have used many different brands/models and this one truly works. I still prefer my original one but I have backed down the power to get ""close"" to what i'm used to. I appreciate the re-designed battery compartment. No need to stuff rubberbands around the battery to close.

2557	Liz	McHenry IL	03/11/2016	5	MS	Thus far I am very satisfied with this unit. Sadly I fell last year by a neighbor and tho I thought I was ok one thing lead to another and things really snowballed. I was getting tens & ice at PT after a needed shoulder surgery and since the price was good I ordered this. After telling the physical therapist I ordered a unit he agreed to check it out for me and show me how to use it. He was impressed saying it was a lot better than the small unit they had. I like the unit. It is small and easy to use. While I was only shown one mode eventually I will try out the others. This little unit works just as well as the big one I used to get hooked up to at physical therapy. I highly recommend a unit like this because it does make you feel sooo gooood. Using this will and does help ailments or at the very least ease ailments or pain. I hope the unit keeps working for years to come.

The product is really good, although the battery could use a little more punch (you can easily replace a 9V battery anyways).

I have been using it for several months now, and it works great to relieve pain. I have not yet explored all the many programs and variables that can be used, but have found some that work for me.

2568	Dre	California	09/16/2015	5	Great for many types of injuries	I was in 2 car accidents, 2 months apart from each other and both times the car I was in was totaled. I have various injuries, some spinal, some soft tissue, some nerve damage, some joint problems. In each case, I have different kinds of pain, and varying levels throughout the day. I switch placement of the electrodes and use each setting in different places. Its easy to figure out what your body needs and where. I absolutely love this thing. Once I figured out how I felt with each mode, I tailored my own treatment in the course of a few days, and I'm getting mobility I hadn't imagined I'd get back so soon. It's really a fantastic machine, and I love that it has a belt clip and works on a battery! It works for about 12-18 hours on a battery, which isn't bad I think.It would really benefit from including an electrode placement map, though!

2572	LR	Florida	08/14/2015	5	fibromyalgia patient	LOVE this TENS unit! Make SURE to do some research on TENS pad placements and settings BEFORE you use it. The wrong placement/wrong settings can mean the difference between pain relief and no help at all. The only thing I do not like about this unit is that you can't hold down the up/down buttons when making setting adjustments, and they beep for EVERY click. Make SURE to get the AC adapter. I've found the red Duracell batteries last the longest, but I just bought myself some SunLabz 300mAh NiMH 9V rechargeable batteries from Amazon, and a charger, and hope that helps cut down on battery prices. (Be careful what brand rechargeables you get, because some rechargeables are physically slightly larger in size and might not fit.) I get really bad myofascial muscle knots in my shoulders and neck because of my fibro and this is the only thing that REALLY helps give me any kind of relief. Play with the settings, learn how to work it. Find what settings work best for you, and make note of them so you have your own cheat sheet of settings.

2578	Robert Yantiss	Hot Springs, NC	06/29/2015	4	user, patient	So far the Select Combo seems to be working as intended, especially after my doctor showed me the optimum location for the pads and best mode (IF) for my issue. I only have one complaint, which is the very short life of the 9-volt battery in the unit, especially for the IF mode. Perhaps the design of the unit could be improved to be more efficient using the newer electronic technologies now being developed and made available to the market. The reason being that for active individuals who want to use their TENS/IF/EMA/MC units throughout the day in a mobile manner while they are engaged in other activities that require moving from place to place (i.e. non-stationary, multi-location), the requirement to be tethered to one location by the necessity of using the AC adaptor greatly reduces this flexibility. (One of the main reasons for which I purchased this unit was for its portability.) So a unit that was much more efficient would significantly increase the longevity of the batteries and thus the flexibility and usefulness of the unit. <–– (just my thoughts)	InTENSity Select Combo TENS, EMS, IF, & Microcurrent Unit + Free A/C Power Adapter Included	https://www.tenspros.com/

This thing has held up very nice. It has not given my any problems at all. It is simple to use and has a lot of different setting for each of the 4 modes this unit has. This gives you many different settings depending on how you are feeling for that day. I highly recommend this company they truly do care about their customers. the phone reps are very knowledgeable and will answer any question you ask.

2583	jim	America	04/21/2015	5	Satisfied customer	I use this as my home unit, because it can function on a 9 volt battery or house AC current. I was skeptical, about this unit and the cost but I wanted to try the different modes to see which one worked best. My first unit had a screen issues but it was replace promptly the company was very good about standing behind their product. Excellent rating for that. I am glad I got this unit, after trying all four of the setting. I dialed in on one mode that work well for pain relief but over the course of time I have learned that my body is going to respond better to different settings at any given time. So this unit works quite well. With four setting you don't have to be a professional if one is uncomfortable or not helping try the next one until you find the mode and setting. After a few time your body will have you trained. At home I live on this unit. I start my day with it and end my day with it. I am very glade I have it, my only regret is that I did not get one sooner. Get extra electrode pads, if you use this units like I do for hours and hours and hours a day you will need them. Start with at least a 10 pack. PS. the included battery is not the best quality. If you plan on running them on battery power buy some good batteries.

2585	Beth Hacker	Washington	04/01/2015	5	Awesome	I purchased this because I tore the tendons and ligaments in my fingers, tore the nerves in my wrist and arm, and 2 tendons in the wrist. After surgery I had severe nerve pain from the damage. My doctors and therapist told me to get a tens unit for home use. I looked at just about every website and tens unit out there. I decided on this one because of several reasons, the cost for the product was perfect, the programs were what I needed in all aspects, and it came with everything I needed. I do recommend getting the rechargeable 9 volt batteries and the rechargeable charger to save time and money in the long run. So back to this, I used the tens most of the time and have it programmed to what I can tolerate to help with pain. I use the EMS when I need to do resistance to try to get flexion back in the fingers and wrist. So overall, buy this and you will be happy.

The instructions for each mode was a little overwhelming and confusing but my physical therapist gave me simple instruction and I have not had a problem."	InTENSity Select Combo TENS, EMS, IF, & Microcurrent Unit + Free A/C Power Adapter Included	https://www.tenspros.com/
2607	Mike	NY	06/16/2014	5	Intensity Select Combo	The unit works great, Lots of options for the type of treatment you need. Ive used this unit for over a month and it works as good as new. The AC adaptor keeps everything at full power and the electro pads I ordered are lasting well. It dose take a few tries to get the shock you want, but in the end, I did figure out all the buttons and different selections. Also a great heavy duty carry case to store when not in use.

2608	Rob C.	Ottawa, Canada	06/09/2014	5	One Powerful Little Unit !!	The guy from Chicago that only gave 3 out of 5 stars was misinformed. This is one powerful little machine. Any unit that does interferential(IF) will eat up batteries in the IF mode. That's the way it is. It's not a battery issue with this unit in particular. If anyone wants to use any portable IF unit, be prepared to to supply the power required to run any unit in that mode. This unit is affordable, versatile, powerful, compact, and certainly not a toy. Highly recommended.	InTENSity Select Combo TENS, EMS, IF, & Microcurrent Unit + Free A/C Power Adapter Included	https://www.tenspros.com/
2609	(Verified Buyer) PAUL BRACKLEY	Chicago, IL	05/03/2014	3	Intensity Combo--Only one Major Drawback	"I have Spondylo Arthritis and Degenerative Disc Disease. Nothing is a cure-all for me, but TENS has been a part of my treatment regimen for years (using the Empi Select). I wear the TENS for most of my waking hours, in addition to taking prescription pain meds, receiving periodic IV infusions, etc.
I really like the positive effect of the IF mode on this unit, but its big drawback is that it burns through batteries FAST. Knowing that in advance, I purchased an extra power pack and a good charger with 4 high-quality rechargeable 9 V batteries.
When using batteries alone I'm lucky to get 1-1/2 to 2 hours use, so to get the device's full effect I need to stay connected to an AC power source. This significantly limits its usefulness because I can't move about freely like I'm used to doing with my Empi TENS.
From reading I've done, it appears that few insurance plans will knowingly pay for an IF TENS unit. So that makes the high-priced devices, like the Empi IF 3Wave a fairly expensive personal investment.
My main reason for trying the Intensity Combo was to see how effective IF therapy would be without having to make a huge financial investment. I think I can confidently say that the IF therapy is more effective than conventional TENS treatment. So now I need to decide whether or not to jump through the necessary hoops to get a device that is engineered to last longer in between battery charges.
If it weren't for the battery issue, I'd give this a 4-star or higher rating."	InTENSity Select Combo TENS, EMS, IF, & Microcurrent Unit + Free A/C Power Adapter Included	https://www.tenspros.com/

The pain is staying away longer after each use. Shots didn't work but this definitely does. I'm so glad I gave it a try and the low price was an extra bonus.

2613	eric tanner	Wichita, Kansas	02/27/2014	5	Select combo 14 review	I have had this item for about 2 months. And I have to tell you. Great quality, alot of options, and worth every cent! I have had lower back pain for years. I can feel my back tighten up every couple of weeks. I will use this product on that area and my pain does go away, not for hours..........but for days. I totally believe in this technology and does relieve and help to minimize pain in muscles. I had used things like this in pyhsical therapy ordered by my doctor a couple of years back and wanted one ever since. SO I bought this and its better than the ones the doctors use for therapy. A+ product from and A+ seller. Good Job and thank you!!!	InTENSity Select Combo TENS, EMS, IF, & Microcurrent Unit + Free A/C Power Adapter Included	https://www.tenspros.com/
2614	linda	Michigan	02/11/2014	5	InTENSity Select Combo TENS, EMS, IF & Micro	I was really skeptical when I order this product. I wasn't sure it would work for me. My skeletal has been out of alignment for years due to a back injury. The whole left side had shifted almost an inch lower than the right side. (one leg shorter than the other, carpal tunnel surgery on both hands) A chiropractor re-aligned it after 2 ½ months of treatments. The muscles in my shoulders and arms were so sore I could not lift my arms above my head, due to the rotator cuff group of muscles and tendons that surround the shoulder joint, keeping the head of your upper arm bone firmly within the shallow socket of the shoulder. These muscles were not use to being aligned in this position. SO I put this to the test…For the first week I used it every day for 30-45 min a day on my arms. I was amazed the pain started to go away and I could lift my arms above my head. I now use this about once a week, if I am feeling sore. I love the fact that this has TENS, EMS, IF & Micro. I have used them all… I do prefer the IF and the Micro for muscle soreness. I love this product and I would recommend it, you cannot beat the product or the price. I no longer have the pain in my shoulders and upper arms. Its great. I also love the fact it has a AC adapter and a back-up battery. Easy to use and walk around with the devise.

They are not as good as the tan ones. the sticky gel backing comes off real easy and I'm always getting it off my fingers or where they were on my body. find it some times in my bed on the sheet. The tan ones never did that but when I ordered you did not have them anymore. I don't have a choice.

2696	Johnna	Baytown	10/03/2018	5	Ms	I have an older 10s unit that I have loved from this company but the leads had kinked and it wasnt working well so I initially thought id buy a newer machine with some of the fancy options. It was terrible (cheaply made, no cover for the settings so it would switch and turn off and on when you werent expecting it, too large to fit discretely into a pocket at work). I was so happy to find these leads and be able to get my old standby working again.

The lead wires always seem to go first and last Dec it seemed much too quick a time for this to happen, but the situation was handled correctly and professionally as I was promptly sent a replacement and I also bought 3 more. They are such a resonable price and work great.

However, I have been asked to review this product for TensPro. This product is wires, and as wires go, they're as good as any, I guess.
Here's the thing. I've been dealing with TensPro for a year or so now, and consider them to be a superlative company who provide the best possible products in their industry. Their prices are beyond fair - into the realm of impossibly good. I actually find myself feeling like I'm stealing this stuff. Their prices tend to be at least 50% - if not 25% - of anybody else providing these products, and their quality and flexibility is orders of magnitude better than their closest competitor. Turn around time is also amazing, as I generally receive fulfilled orders in only a few days. Receipts and confirmations arrive in my inbox immediately.
In summation - and for FREE - I can't recommend them highly enough. If you're interested in Tens technology, this is the only company you'll ever need."	45'' Standard Length Premium Lead Wires	https://www.tenspros.com/

I'm writing to you as the second type of person. I've used my TENS unit for over a year now.
It's been very helpful in reducing chronic pain.
I use it every day so my recommendation is based on heavy use.
I've found that I need to replace the wires every few months and the pads every week.
I'm not claiming this item is a miracle device that will make all pain disappear every time you use it. In my case it worked on some of the many types of back pain I live with everyday. So it's one of the many tools I use to improve my quality of life.
If you've never tried it before and you live in chronic pain then it's worth your while to see if you respond to it. I hope it helps you."	45'' Standard Length Premium Lead Wires	https://www.tenspros.com/

2790	Michelle	Oregon	02/12/2016	3	Consumer	I purchased this knee scooter for my upcoming knee surgery which I had Oct. 22, 2015 and very glad I did. I am an active mom and appreciated the flexibility I had with being on wheels. That being said... I am from a rainy state, Oregon. I happens to be our rainy seasons so admittedly, there is quite a bit of water to contend with. The bearing on this scooter are NOT made to get wet often. Though it is reliable, it is forever squeaking! Additionally the brake cable wore through at the connection below the basket which causes the breaks to engage unexpectedly! That's always fun!! Mind you I really used this scooter so it definitely was tested on a daily basis... At the end of the day and after 5 months of use it is still good to go but will have to have bearings lubricated again and new brake cable... Side note: if you get a fiberglass cast or intend to use the scooter for months... GET THE KNEE COVER or if your frugal like me, cover it with a hand towel & rubber bands!

2796	H. Baker	NY	03/13/2015	4	Mr.	Good looking, sturdy, and real reasonable. Worth buying, rather than renting. The only cons are not enough padding for knee, and hard to use on carpet(tips over). I also bought the padded cover, and it's too thin to make a difference.	Roscoe Premium Knee Scooter with Free Carry Basket, Four Wheels, Adjustable Brakes, and Padded Seat	https://www.tenspros.com/
2797	Barbara Gillespie	Phoenix, AZ	03/01/2015	5	Easy Glider	I had broken my wrist and my foot! This scooter was so easy to maneuver, I was still able to use my injured wrist to ride this scooter.

2800	Elaine Thompson	Heyburn, Idaho	02/16/2015	5	Rollabout	I had surgery on my ankle and they put 5 screws in it plus scrapping some bone and put heal back where it was suppose to be and fused all together. I had to stay completely off that foot for 2 months and don't know what I would have done if it wasn't for this knee scooter. It was a great price and you can't go wrong in getting this if your in need of one.

2801	Fletcher	Texas	02/16/2015	4	Teacher	I used my knee scooter after surgery on my achilles tendon where I couldn't put any weight on my foot for 6 weeks. It was a thousand times better than crutches. It gave me the freedom to teach my class without having to stand on crutches-I could use my arms/hands for the board and showing examples! I did have 2 falls-one when I was trying to go over a very rocky path, and another when the basket was too full and I was trying to go up a step! It's not easy going up steps, but going down wasn't too bad! It was a little cumbersome traveling with it-it's not the kind that folds down all the way. But overall, I loved it!

2802	Kevin Fabry	DePere, Wisconsin	02/11/2015	5	Mr.	"I would definetly rate the service and quality of the product a ""10"". I ordered on a Wednesday morning and received it the same Friday. Tens pro originally told me I would receive it the following Monday or Tuesday and to my surprise, I had it for my wife, the day after her surgery. Great service and great product. I highly recommend this for anyone with either foot surgery (what my wife had)or any other lower leg problem, over a pair of crutches."

2803	Dorotha Allen	Tallahassee	01/22/2015	5	Appraiser	I got around great with this scooter. Easy to use. Breaks to slow down or stop. Able to put break on when your not using it to keep it from rolling away or getting on and off the scooter. The turn radius is not fantastic but it does the job. The basket is wonderful. I couldn't have managed without it. I found out it was cheaper to buy one than rent one or wait a couple months for the insurance company to figure out what there doing.

2804	Joyce Taylor	Georgia	01/09/2015	5	none	I bought this knee scooter for my son-in-law after his right heel was crushed in an automobile accident. He was not able to put any weight on that foot for about 12 weeks and this knee scooter was just perfect! He was able to get around and do just about everything from cooking to going out to get the mail. Loved the basket as well!

2806	loretta	Florida	12/27/2014	5	Roscoe knee scooter	"I love, love, love the roscoe knee scooter. It is very easy to maneuver by simply standing on good leg, balance, and pick it up and turn around if you get into a tight spot. I had no problem with my ""pony"" as I recovered from a 4 week no weight bearing ankle surgery. I would advise don't get overconfident, focus, and respect your scooter. I love it so much that I was loathe to put it up when I didn't need it anymore. This is a reasonable price and I figured why not buy one for $ 40 more than if I rented one for 4 weeks.

2808	John Hall	Michigan (MI)	12/24/2014	5	Mr.	Tried crutches (again), walker (perfect at first), knee crutch (stuck out behind posing issues-had to take on and off all the time), and a non-load bearing full length leg brace and ALWAYS went back to this. Folded and went right in the hatch of my car and I carefully hopped to the driver's door and went to work and used it all day. I actually hurt (back ache) when I was promoted to a walking cast and missed the scooter.

2809	Lisa	Cleveland, OH	12/24/2014	5	Miss	Provides better stability and balance than crutches ever could. Limited turning radius provides safety to prevent falls, basket is really handy.

I have had some difficulty on rough surfaces and grass. I wouldn't trade it for crutches ever. My Dr. likes the pad cover too. I can do most things like cook simple meals or shop at the drug store.

I returned to work 3 weeks ago and am able to accomplish everything I need to do in the course of the day. Wish I had known about this 2 years ago for my first foot surgerys.

2818	kimberly	Greenville, SC	10/31/2014	5	Couldn't survive without it!	You've had surgery, or you've injured yourself. You're on crutches, in a cast or maybe a boot. Crutches are HARD. They tire you out. You can't carry anything in your hands. Heck, you can't even use a purse 'cause you'd be off balance! This scooter saved my life. It relieve my weak, aching arms and the basket allowed me to carry things from room to room in the house.

2820	Rick	Milton, FL	10/22/2014	5	A must for those who need mobility assistance	Top quality build and provides the mobility needed for those who had foot or ankle surgery. Handbrake and basket are a great addition when moving around the house or going to the doctors office. Can easily fold down for the back seat in the car or leave it together and put it in the trunk. You can rent these from other companies but the you can buy this for a lot less.

2821	Ashley	Austin, Texas	10/14/2014	5	Mrs.	"The knee scooter was great! I took my 4th grade troop to San Antonio for a week and was able to use it thru out the mission, river walk and sea world with my girls. The took turns folding it down and putting in and out of my car for me. It held up really well and works great on all services.
It is a challenge some times on grated or deep grated areas of stone or brick that maybe a bigger wheel would work, but controllable. Also the seat cover is tearing and a nicer cover is recommended especially somewhere hot like Central Texas in the summer. The seat gets very slick on bare skin if you are wearing shorts.
I'll still give it 5 stars since there is no 4.5 and 4 is really too low, but the scooter saved many a falls I would have had on crutches and I would never have been as mobile!"

This scooter was a God send. Very good quality. I used it daily for a few months. The scooter worked great inside the house, on hard floor and carpet, and outside on sidewalks and driveways. Now, unfortunately for her, my mother-in-law is using the scooter for a broken ankle. It has held up nicely. As for the vendor they were extremely fast to ship the scooter.

2830	Carolyn Pines	Oakland, CA	09/03/2014	5	Essential Investment!!!	"I had foot surgery six weeks ago, and in anticipation beforehand, searched online for a knee scooter. There were several brands and styles from which to choose -- and a range of prices -- but I met someone at a wedding who had this particular Roscoe scooter (in mahogany red), and it looked to me to be solid and easy-to-use. I continued to shop online for the best price and chose to buy from TensPros for two reasons -- the most competitive price and the fact that I could call them and get all my questions answered from a real (and helpful) person! The scooter arrived in just a few days and was relatively easy to set up. It's been a lifesaver -- indoors (it rides great on smooth floors but worked okay for me also on the parts of my home that are carpeted) and outdoors ('though you need to be more attentive on rough pavements, and take the bumps slowly). Turns are wide (which is a safety factor to maintain balance), and I find it's helpful to ""lift and turn"" the scooter a bit to make tighter turns, which hasn't been a problem. The basket holds a lot and can serve as a resting place for conveying large items. I'm so grateful I discovered this knee scooter, as it's enabled me to have much easier/smoother mobility than crutches provide and empowered me to be able to do more by freeing up my arms and hands and holding things in the basket. Being able to sit down to rest on it is also a plus (I also bought and appreciate the faux sheepskin cover for the seat). I couldn't recommend this product more highly -- for both its quality and the ""quality of life"" it brought to my healing process!

2833	Robin	GA	08/13/2014	5	Knee Scooter to the Rescue	"I ruptured my Achilles Tendon in May and required surgery to repair the injured tendon. I spent the first 12 days on crutches....needless to say, I was so relieved and excited to get my knee walker; it arrived 1 day before my surgery.
My husband assembled it in minutes and I was able to get familiar with it the night before my achilles tendon repair surgery.
After my surgery, it was great to have the knee walker to get to any area of my home quickly....especially in the middle of the night while groggy on pain pills.
The use of the knee walker also helped me maintain muscles normally lost during three months of being in a zero weight bearing state. Also, after my surgery, while working from home, the basket was great for transporting my laptop, food, cell phone, etc. around the house.

I found crutches were difficult in certain situations, and certainly for getting around the kitchen. I bought this Knee Scooter because of it's reasonable price (the same as a 2 week rental) and have found it indispensable. It is sturdy yet still light weight enough for me to pick it up to pivot when needed, take down a few stairs and pack in my car. The basket on front was so handy. I will use it again after surgery on my other foot. I would highly recommend its use!

I cannot imagine anything better to get around on.... so much better than crutches or a walker. I have not been able to do any weight bearing yet.This would have saved me so many times I had to ask someone to help me I could have been much more independent. I am unable to use crutches.

2844	Ali	Decatur	03/30/2023	5	Awesome product and amazing service!	"Fantastic service from TENS Pros!! I ordered late on Monday, they shipped out Tuesday, and arrived on Thursday. I’m using these for vagus nerve stimulation and hoping it will help with anxiety and depression. For tips on how to use a pair of these to make one double clip, I recommend looking at the Washington Wellness Center (videos) for an easy hack. All you need is a strong pair of scissors and some super glue. I’m not entirely sure why these need to be made into one clip, but that’s what I’ve mostly seen online so that’s what I did! I’ve also seen folks use two clips on two different places on the left ear, or one clip on the left ear and one patch on the back shoulder so I think there are a few ways to go about using these. There are also plenty of tips online for exactly where to clip these on your left ear and how to program your TENS unit for gentle vagus nerve stimulation. TENS Pros cannot give you medical advice as they are just our trusty source for supplies! However, you can find plenty of information and tips online to get you going. Do your research and make sure to read the manual on your TENS unit for safety precautions.
I’m using these with a TENS 7000, and with a pair of ear clips that is all you need to get started. I do not recommend getting the white clips that are all over Amazon and elsewhere as they seem to be of low quality and every reliable health source I’ve looked at online uses these black ear clips. I purchased an extra set to have on hand just in case, but they are well made and I think they will last a long time. I just did my first session and they worked great (programmed my TENS unit to 20 minutes on ‘Normal’ mode, 200 microseconds, 30 Hz and turned the dial up to just below ‘3’). 10/10 stars! I highly recommend this product and TENS Pros all around. Customer service and shipping times have declined so much in the last few years, so it’s really refreshing and greatly appreciated to receive such stellar service. Happy healing!"

I suffer from treatment resistant depression and had learned about Vagus nerve stimulation. Finding a product though was nigh impossible. However, these are fantastic. The clip is strong enough to clip onto my lobe and ear piece near the canal without hurting. It takes only the barest amount of gel to get great conduction as well. I can't recommend them highly enough. I am so pleased I am buying some for my mum and in-laws. The product is great. The customer experience was excellent. And the delivery was quick and inexpensive.

I use a little gel for better conductivity. Much easier than using tens pads and cutting them down. Using for vagal stim for depression, maybe some subtle improvements, no downside as with drugs.

2887	TM	Delafield, WI	08/10/2018	5	Black Ear Clips	Prior to ordering these clips, I used the old white ones that had recently been discontinued. The old white ones had a metal contact that had a cheap coating that wore away very quickly and caused pain while in use. I ordered the black ear clips. When I received them, I found that the contacts are hard rubber. I also found that the spring within the clip was about twice as strong as the old white clips. Have used them several times and they are holding up very well. The new black clips are very easy to clean and appear that they will last a long time. When I need more, I will use Tens Pros again. Best price I could find anywhere. Thank you Tens Pros!	Black Ear Clip Electrodes for Cranial Electrotherapy Stimulation	https://www.tenspros.com/

2896	Cassandra	55431	10/28/2015	5	The search ends here	"Having taken 1 solid month to date of using these ear clips for a variety of issues including but not limited to:
Seasonal Depression, Anxiety, PTSD, Mood stability, etc.
I am so very grateful to be able to share my experience to this point being at a 5 star rating, and would rate higher if possible. Both my husband and I have begin using CES treatment and agree on the following:
Immediate results, Fog lifted from your mind, Focus much clearer, Anxiety highly diminishing, Mood stability increasing, Less stress, and Less frustration in chaotic situations, Ability to think clearly and complete tasks, as well as face tasks that seemed worth procrastinating on before.
I began a journal the 1st week of treatment just to keep track, oddly and unexpectedly - I stopped craving soda and my body craved healthier drinks/food. This kind of faded after a few weeks but set me on a healthier path! Also sleep??? Omg. Like a BABY for 2 weeks in a row. Now again has somewhat leveled out and 2 nights out of the week I may face a bit of insomnia, however I do believe my insomnia was a lifelong problem before hand.
I could go on and on. Please give it a chance if you suffer from anything at all. You owe it to yourself and to your loved ones to be the best you possible."	Black Ear Clip Electrodes for Cranial Electrotherapy Stimulation	https://www.tenspros.com/

2956	Darrin Snihur	Bridgeport, CT	04/02/2018	5	Mr.	"I have Fanomerol Stenosis in the L3 to L5 region of my back, and, the 2"" x 2"" electrodes would help with the pain and muscle relaxation of the region affected. But, once I tried the larger 2"" by 3.5"" electrodes, I noticed a considerable difference in how much relief I got from those electrodes. Because of the greater amount of coverage, more of my back felt less stiff and less pain than with the smaller electrodes. From now on, it'll only be the larger electrodes for my back pain."	2'' x 3.5'' Premium White Cloth Electrodes - 4/pack	https://www.tenspros.com/

3140	Sabine	Utah	07/03/2023	5	Pain free	This pad, being the length that it is, covers my whole lower back, where I suffer from chronic sciatica. I'm SO grateful for this product and the quality of it, that I encourage anyone with similar pain, to use it. You will not regret it. The gel really sticks. It doesn't come off when you peel the pad off of your skin; plus, it lasts for weeks. I bought 10 pads this time. I was buying a similar pad on Amazon and after one use, the gel stuck to my back and I would get shocked. Not with these pads.

Of course, it doesn't help to Rear End a NY State Trooper either. The shoulder harness held tight and my shoulders slapped together ripping all the muscles in my upper back.

Great quailty and unlike some electrodes that lose their sticking ability this pad has gone through numerous uses and sticks just as well as the first use.

3155	S OConnell	Pickens SC	04/17/2018	5	Mrs	I cannot thank you enough for these extra long electrode strips!

The gel has kept them secure through at least eight days of all day uses and still stick well. I am so very pleased with these that I recently placed another order because I do not want to run out. Please don’t discontinue these as long as I am alive!! Even my chiropractor wanted them when she saw them on my back so I gave her your website and hope she enjoys your company and customer assistance.

3158	LM	GA	02/08/2018	5	Great for low back	"I don't often submit reviews unless a product is far above or below expectations. Having herniated discs in my low back for years, I've used the regular pads which are ""ok"". These extended length pads are SO much better, easier to use, and stay in place much better. The ability to obtain the much wider application of the TENS means better pain relief. Highly recommended and good price too."	1.5'' x 14'' White Foam Low Back Pain Electrode Strip	https://www.tenspros.com/

3161	Irene	Virginia	07/10/2017	5	Mrs	The greatest - well all of them are. This one helps the best because it is one long strip instead of many little ones but those are needed at different times. I have purchased many of their different shapes and I love them all. This one I will be buy again and more at a time also the 2 X 3.5 which I only bought one to try it out also as I was use to the standard 2X2 which I bought 50 of them on my last order. They work great especially if you wipe the area your putting them on down with rubbing alcohol first to remover the oil from your skin. I have trouble getting them to stick even with their products because of my MS. The products are great and the prices are even better. Thanks for the great selections and l look forward to new selections.	1.5'' x 14'' White Foam Low Back Pain Electrode Strip	https://www.tenspros.com/
3162	Thom	Florida	06/21/2017	5	Dr. (in training)	I love these strips and I should have ordered more of them. However, I'm going to remedy that right now. Have had 3 surgeries including fusion on my lower back with no releif. These help keep the pain down but I really wish I knew how to use my device better to make the most use out of these pad. FYI, these are really good at sticking for an 8 hour or more stretch.	1.5'' x 14'' White Foam Low Back Pain Electrode Strip	https://www.tenspros.com/

3170	William	Phoenix	09/02/2016	4	Mr.	I was not as happy with this product as I hoped I would be. It tended to fall off more than the smaller electrode patches (I think due to the area in the middle that separates the electric pads..) The electrode strip worked well otherwise, so for people who don't sweat too much or don't engage in activities like pulling weeds and bending over or pushing a weedeater, it might be more suitable.	1.5'' x 14'' White Foam Low Back Pain Electrode Strip	https://www.tenspros.com/

3176	Steve M	OH	03/17/2016	5	Dr.	This is absolutely the best, easiest to use, and simpliest to apply electrode strip I have encountered for lumbar region back pain. It works well with both my Omron and TENS 2000 units. The strip is rigid enough to apply, but flexible enough for movement when in place. Included is a semi-rigid strip to cover the pad when not in use. It's quite sticky and my only suggestion for imnpovement would be tabs at both ends to facilitate removal. Based on my recent experience and other reviews, I have recommended this electrode strip to others.	1.5'' x 14'' White Foam Low Back Pain Electrode Strip	https://www.tenspros.com/
3177	Cappy	Bonneau, S C - 29431	03/01/2016	5	Disabled	"I like the 1.5"" X 14"" white foam strips, I believe I've use the one strip most every day for the pat few weeks. My tens unit if of the old kind and so far I can't find anyone to reapply the unit for me. All they know is that I can barely walk without wearing the tens unit, getting back to the strips the foam ones are the best. After over twelve years or so using the unit medicare won't pay for a new one evern thought they said to find a supplier that go by the new guide lines. Anyway I've been through alot of pads and the foam ones are the best and I can make them last at least a month. The smaller pads just came in the premium white cloth which after two days use are coming apart. I wish they would make the smaller pads with your white foam. My supplies I received before was the Empi brand. All were not satisfactory just like these I've ordered from you."	1.5'' x 14'' White Foam Low Back Pain Electrode Strip	https://www.tenspros.com/

3294	Dan Goodale	Phoenix, Az	05/03/2015	5	Great product, great service, great price	"I've been buying all my TENS units from Tens Pros since I first discovered them on the web. The reason? They just can't be beat!
I'm a frugal buyer. I ALWAYS shop but at this point I don't SEE the point. EVERY time I compare price and quality Tens Pros wins hands down.
I've shopped at Amazon and Ebay and there's no way to beat their product or their price. Every time Tens Pros had the best deal whether I was buying a TENS unit or just Electrodes.
The one time I had a question about payment they responded promptly and courteously. At work nowadays when a friend is in pain, I let him try my TENS unit and direct him right here. You just can't go wrong buying from Tens Pros.
When my back starts to ache, Tens Pros gives me a break.
Thanks TensPros!

3321	Theresa Butkowski	Willis	08/23/2021	5	Great for sensitive skin	These electrode pads are great for a person like myself . I have sensitive skin and most electrode pads break my skin out. These pads stick well to clean skin. I can use them several times a day with good results. The only downside it that after you remove them, it leaves a little of the adhesive on my skin. It is easily removed by wiping off with a tissue. I will buy these again.	PROTENS 2'' x 2'' Hypo-Allergenic Blue Cloth Electrodes For Sensitive Skin	https://www.tenspros.com/

3331	Bonnie	Ocean Springs	12/19/2019	5	Ms.	I wear my TENS all day long, These electrodes are hypoallergenic, and they don't make my back break out in a rash, but for some reason they keep catching on my clothing and peeling off. They don't need to be trimmed around the edges to keep the gel from squishing out, so I don't understand why they keep peeling back and sticking on my clothes. However, they are a good buy and they don't bother my skin, so I will continue to buy them. They work better than the PALS electrodes I have been buying for many years. Those need to be trimmed around the edges and they don't last very long. These PROTENS electrodes have an adhesive that continues to work day after day, and the electrodes themselves are durable. I am using the same ones I started with a week ago and they are still holding up.	PROTENS 2'' x 2'' Hypo-Allergenic Blue Cloth Electrodes For Sensitive Skin	https://www.tenspros.com/

They are very cost effective compared to the other hypoallergenic brand.	PROTENS 2'' x 2'' Hypo-Allergenic Blue Cloth Electrodes For Sensitive Skin	https://www.tenspros.com/

3341	Patti Beam	Jamestown	03/19/2019	3	Mrs.	"I have had trouble with electrodes breaking me out.The Blue Cloth Electrodes are good on my skin. They don't break me out at all but they sure can't be used much. After about 3 times putting them they lose the stickiness. I use the gel on them that I have use on other pads at it takes ALL the stickiness off of them. I have to wear the Tens most every day because of surgery and need a pad that is hypo allergenic. These meet that great but they are going to be expensive since they just don't last all that long.
so rating them is kind of hard. Would give 5 star for not breaking me out but probably a 2 because they just don't last long."	PROTENS 2'' x 2'' Hypo-Allergenic Blue Cloth Electrodes For Sensitive Skin	https://www.tenspros.com/
3342	Cathy	Ga	03/17/2019	5	Great hypoallergenic pads kills the rash	The blue tens pads are great. With standard pads my whole back and neck would be a solid rash, even if I did not have a pad in that spot. With these pads I have almost no marks anywhere on my back and if I need to I can put the pads back in the same place the next day. As always they lose some of the stickiness after the first use. But the recommendations are to put a few drops of water on the pad and that generally works. I would say they stick as well as the non hypoallergenic. I have not tried the gel as a supplement to stickiness, just water. I have used two sets of 4 in rotation for about 4 weeks on a 24/7 basis. Occasionally I have one sticking to my shirt but it is usually when I am sleeping and wiggling in bed. If you get any rash from regular pads I highly recommend these hypoallergenic pads.

3426	Shelley	texas	06/09/2022	4	Ms	Can’t live without a TENS machine in the house and this is a very good product. Lost a star though because the plug for the lead wires is too close to the cover and volume knob. If you try and open the cover and adjust the volume knobs you risk detaching the lead wire plug. Design needs to be improved. Never had this with my 1000 TENS product.	TENS 7000 2nd Edition Digital TENS Unit with 5 Modes and Timer	https://www.tenspros.com/
3427	Melissa	Jonesville, LA	06/06/2022	5	Office Manager	We are a small rural pharmacy that supplies medical equipment to the public. The local physical therapist recommends the same Tens unit he uses in his practice to all his patients. We are proud to sell such a quality Tens unit at an affordable price. Absolutely no complaints from this unit. We also recommend this Tens Unit. The fast and accurate attention to each order by Tens Pros makes them a dream to deal with in today's retail world. I highly recommend Tens Pro and this Tens unit.	TENS 7000 2nd Edition Digital TENS Unit with 5 Modes and Timer	https://www.tenspros.com/
3428	Paul	Alabama	06/05/2022	4	95% Satisfied	Unit arrived with both case latches broken but the Tens Unit was fine. They could not send just a new replacement case so the manager sent me extra electrodes to make up for the defect. I bought the unit to relieve wrist pain from surgery which works wonderfully. My General Practitioner had recommended I get one of these for my sciatica, it works wonderfully on that as well as neck and shoulder tension. If you have reoccurring pain I highly recommend investing in this Tens7000 unit for relief.	TENS 7000 2nd Edition Digital TENS Unit with 5 Modes and Timer	https://www.tenspros.com/

3432	Sharon Kaufman	Greensburg, PA	03/03/2022	5	TENS 7000 review	I’m loving my TENS unit! I really needed pain relief in several areas & I’m getting it! I’ve recommended this specific unit & your company to 3 people who have issues with pain. I can’t say enough good things about this! Very well pleased. Not sure about electrode placement in areas I need it and I have some additional questions. If I had to give a less stellar review it would be for the self-adhering tan cloth electrodes as they didn’t stick well after 3 uses. I’m glad I had the forethought to buy additional electrodes that were on a great sale! Thank you for a great product!

3451	Sam	Hudson, MA	04/03/2021	5	Works well!	I recently received the TENS 7000 and apply it to my lower back several times each week. The range of stimulation is quite high and at this time I can go up to #4. This gives me at least 1 hour of pain relief. It works well. For my part applying the electrodes can be awkward placing them around on my lower back. I have recommended it to a couple of friends and believe they will order their own TENS 7000 soon.

3462	Roy	Wa	02/06/2021	5	Back Pain Gone!	It's easy to see why the TENS 7000 is such a popular model. It does everything you need for a very reasonable price. I was dealing with back pain waking me up every morning. A few sessions of using the TENS 7000 before retiring for the evening not only eliminated it for the following morning, but for about an entire week afterward! Pretty amazing how it works! Might be a little difficult to adjust if you have large hands and fingers. For me, however, that's a minor inconvenience for how well this unit works.

3463	Natalie	Florida	01/27/2021	5	Miss	Extremely satisfied with my TENS 7000. I turned the knobs too fast and was totally lit up at just level 4! Wow!

3464	Judy	Tomahawk	01/24/2021	4	Thumbs up	"This is an update of my previous tens unit model which lasted for years. My only complaints are that the previous one ran for 60 minutes, not 30. There is also less room to turn the control knobs. You almost have to press down on the knob with a fingertip to turn them. I was concerned about the ""eats batteries"" review so I have tracked my use. So far, 10 hours on one battery and still going strong so not a problem for me."

3483	(Verified Buyer) Tina Robison	MIDWEST	09/19/2020	5	Best purchase I've made in a long time...	"Was skeptical at first as I figured anything I would buy for such a low price couldn't be that high quality, BUT I'm happy to say I was wrong!
This unit is well made, and I love the case that keeps everything together. It is a powerful little unit as well! The first time I used it, I had a migraine going on, so I set the time for 15 min on Modulation(?) mode I believe. It felt so good! I mean, once I got used to it, I set the strength between 3 and 4 and it felt like the muscles around my shoulders were being kneaded pretty aggressively, which I loved! It made my migraine subside as well, which was amazing!
I tend to use my TensPro at least every other night, and it loosens the tight muscles in my upper shoulder area and mid back. After using it I am able to finally relax and sleep!
This is one of the best purchases I have made. It is good quality and was shipped quickly. Have already recommended to several friends."	TENS 7000 2nd Edition Digital TENS Unit with 5 Modes and Timer	https://www.tenspros.com/

Also like that covers snap over the controls so that if you want to move around while using the unit, you will not accidentally bump/change any of the settings. Very good value for the price. My only suggestion is that the manual could have more information on where to place the electrodes.	TENS 7000 2nd Edition Digital TENS Unit with 5 Modes and Timer	https://www.tenspros.com/

3499	Joni	FAIRMOUNT	07/13/2020	5	Mrs	I love the TENS unit a lot the only suggestion would be to have more pads because when you sweat and not sticky very long and the stickiness actually comes off of the pads to where they are not usable. Other than that the TENS unit is great easy to take everywhere. You can work with it and it does not get in the way it is a great thing to have	TENS 7000 2nd Edition Digital TENS Unit with 5 Modes and Timer	https://www.tenspros.com/
3500	PittsburghJon49	Aliquippa	07/05/2020	5	Mr.	"Purchased this two years ago for shoulder pain with brand recommendation by a physical therapist. It has worked very well indeed and I have used it at times for lower back pain as well. The reviews I have read suggest that batteries are going dead for others, however that is not my experience because I make certain to turn the dial to off each time after the unit shuts down and so battery life remains good. I am using the tan 1.5 x 1.5"" cloth electrode pads and recommend these - I have had no irritation of any kind with them and find the durability to be pretty good, too. Actually, I like this unit better than my Chiropractor's huge table-top unit, and use a normal setting at about 2 1/2 - 3 for 30-minutes per sesson, starting low and turning it up slowly as tolerated. It appears that this unit will be lasting a very long time, great quality, and price was right at TensPros. Do purchase spare pads and lead wires, folks - I am still using my originals but one never knows what might happen (like Sars-Cov-2) having used up two sets of pads and a couple of batteries in two years time. Highly recommended for quality, price, & service. (Retired Nurse)"	TENS 7000 2nd Edition Digital TENS Unit with 5 Modes and Timer	https://www.tenspros.com/
3501	Chris H	Saginaw, MI	06/30/2020	5	Mr	The tens unit is a miracle in a small package. I have had it for about a week now. It is helping the constant pain that I have had for about 15 yrs now. I have tried all of the modes my favorite is the burst, it feels like someone is giving you a gentle massage then stops a few seconds then starts again and normal is a constant massage.

My husband has a bad back and at times this unit is the only thing that can give him less pain. It enables him to move and flex and keep the muscles in his bad from freezing up. He also loves the fact that he can hook it on his belt and keep it going with him. A lot of tens units that we have tried he needs to put in a pocket or ??? He swears by its great results and recommends the unit to anyone that complains of pain in joints or muscles. Thank you.

I do not like pain relievers or muscle relaxers. I generally use my Tens 7000 in the early morning while drinking my coffee. It took about a week of consistent morning application to get my hips and knees pain free. Now I don't hobble and limp when I get up from a chair.
I can skip about 2 - 3 days per application now. My original Tens 7000 still works but the left electrode has to be in the right position for it to work. Yes, I would purchase again."	TENS 7000 2nd Edition Digital TENS Unit with 5 Modes and Timer	https://www.tenspros.com/

3525	Rick	Rockwall	03/13/2020	5	Tens 7000	I purchased this product because I needed something more than a massage. My muscles appeared to need some sort of stimulation other than your regular hand massage. A massage therapist recommend it so I went directly to the 'TENS' website and ordered the 7000 model. I can't complain and therefore give 5 stars. There are a few options so take your time reading about each product and pick one that best suits your needs. You can place the device on the muscle of choice and pick your pulse setting as well as time setting. This is great!. Another good thing is the ordering process. It was easy, user-friendly and very professional. It was quick and efficient and just as reliable as Amazon. They even followed up with an email. 5-Stars for product and company processing.

But they no longer sell the portable units so I started looking around for another unit. I purchased one from a company that sells on Amazon but it lasted only a day a won't work right after that.

3537	Kim	Peekskill	10/09/2019	5	Licensed Acupuncturist	I so LOVE this TENS 7000 machine!! I did a lot of research and found the TENS 7000 to be the best on the market for effectiveness and price. As a practitioner I suggest this to almost every patient with pain to purchase this (not paid to) and they love the results. As a person who had frozen shoulder and a pulled back muscle I used this TENS to clear my symptoms within 3-5 days (using this with a combo of acupuncture and herbs) which is quite unheard of. It works so great - every household should seriously have one.	TENS 7000 2nd Edition Digital TENS Unit with 5 Modes and Timer	https://www.tenspros.com/
3538	virginia hoover	Fort Wayne	10/03/2019	5	mrs	I love my tens 7000 2nd Edition Digital Tens unit with 5 modes and timer. I had been in therapy for a pinched nerve in my neck and pain in my lower back and hip... while there, they used the 7000 Tens Unit on me with wet heat. I've had so much less pain and the therapist gave me your brochure so I could order one for myself for use at home. I'm so glad I ordered the unit. I can use it whenever I need to. It has been a blessing! Thanks! I rate this a SIX !	TENS 7000 2nd Edition Digital TENS Unit with 5 Modes and Timer	https://www.tenspros.com/

3541	Jo Ann	Colorado Springs	08/16/2019	4	Batteries die wuickly	I love the machine, works well and not expensive. My only negative item is the heavy duty battery that came with it died quickly. Bought 2 more batteries and one of those died quickly as well. Wondering if it's the portable machine part that is causing batteries to die quickly.

3542	Mimi	London, Ontario	08/12/2019	5	Caregiver	"Ordered the TENS 7000 for my mom who has severe pain in her knees from osteoarthritis. Package arrived quickly and in excellent condition and everything included as stated on the website. Used the TENS on my mom after physiotherapist set the parameters for time, intensity, etc. Only disappointment is the placement of the dials on top - the dials are too small and close together that when increasing the level of one dial, I had to be very careful the other one did not move. Requires care and very fine gentle turning of dials. I am right handed so learned it was easier to start with left dial first and then the right dial very gently and slowly otherwise sharp pain from the currents if turn too quickly. My mom is afraid to use the device on her own as she is unable to manage the dials - too small for her and poor eyesight. The numbers on the dials are not useful as I am turning the dials by ""feel"". If she finds the current too low, she will ask it to be gently increased until just right. Otherwise I am happy with the device and recommend it."	TENS 7000 2nd Edition Digital TENS Unit with 5 Modes and Timer	https://www.tenspros.com/

3544	Nancy	Florida	07/19/2019	4	Tens7000	I am very happy with my purchase. Works as well as my 20 year old one . Only thing I do not like is the box it came in. I ended up tossing it and using the soft case from my old unit which has various pockets for storage and spots to hold the device, wires, and charging unit, and batteries. The hard box is heavy and holds very little. Would like to see more programs available to choose from. For the price it is a good unit.

3586	Ben	IN	10/18/2018	5	Mr.	"I severely injured my bicep and it was healing very slowly. My dominate arm was at 50% or less. A friend stopped by and recommended a Tens Machine, said he has one and swears by it. Since he is a landscaper in his 70's, I took note. So I ordered mine. When it arrived, I texted my friend and said, ""Really? I've had bigger pocket transistor radios!"" It was so small and powered by a 9 volt battery, I was very skeptical. Well, 3 weeks or so later, my arm is at 85% and feels a little better every day. I don't know how or why it works, but be assured, it does work. As for the small size and 9 volt battery (I'm still using the first one, so battery life is great, just don't forget to turn it off when you're finished), the dial goes up to 8, but the highest I've been able to use it is at 3 or so. This is one of the few occasions where the product is well worth the cost. If you have muscle pain or injury, do it, you won't regret it!"

I tried it a couple of times and was disappointed in how it operated and performed. Then I underwent spinal surgery and soon after began PT. The therapist at PT used this same TENS Pros device and when he told me the price (<$40 including tax & shipping) I couldn't resist buying it. Love it!

3630	Beverly Rabovsky	Beaver Falls	03/03/2018	5	Mrs.	This is a great little machine. It is far better than the old one I had for years. It had been prescribed by a physician but was only programmed for one specific kind of treatment and shut off after only 20 minutes. I love that this one offers so many different options, and I don't have to keep turning it on every few minutes. Being able to use four electrodes also is a real plus. This is a real gem and well worth the extremely reasonable price. With neck, shoulder, and back problems, I use it often, and it always provides relief. As far as I am concerned, it can't be beat.

However, he has found it great for both a painful hip and a thumb joint. Whenever we want to try a different spot I find a huge chart on the internet to help with electrode placement. Be careful with the plastic piece that you put the electrodes on. If you use all four, then it's tough to see where you laid the plastic.

It's easy to use and travels with me every day. I do wish it had a reset button, rather than having to turn it off when time runs out, to get it going again. Other than that, great product.

3732	zapme	Minnesota	02/15/2017	4	unknown	Nice unit. Priced properly, it has a good variety of modes and the 2 channels work independently without interference. It gets 4/5 stars because the rotating level knobs are small and in a confined spot that requires relatively focused effort to access and use in a controlled manner - which is required because their is a marked increase in intensity that happens very quickly between about 2.4 and 2.6.

3765	Kim Reeder	Homestead	12/18/2016	5	Ms	This TENS machine as literally felt like it has saved my life at times. I have severe chronic back pain and they alway use TENS in physical therapy. I found this unit after spending much more on something that was nowhere near the level of relief that the TENS7000 delivers. I have bought these as gifs for every person who has chronic pain in or is in recovery. This is a must have.	TENS 7000 2nd Edition Digital TENS Unit with 5 Modes and Timer	https://www.tenspros.com/
3766	Donna	Hunterdon County, NJ	12/18/2016	5	Chronic lower back pain and sciatic	"I'm extremely happy with my Tens 7000 Unit. I received the first one from my neurosurgeon for pain relief for Stenosis of the Spine. Also had Stenosis in my neck but the literature suggested to not use on neck area. I purchased a second machine and found that through the mail order on this site, the electro pads, wires, were so inexpensive as a opposed from the surgeon. I have gifted two or three for pain management gifts. I most use my tens pros at least every evening. Some evenings if the pain is extremly heated, I will not use the tens pro and use ice instead. But the following day I must return to the tens machine. I wear a back brace and a 1/2"" lift in my right shoe. I have an extra rib on my left side. So besides the stenosis health issue I have a terrible imbalance which causes terrible pain. But the tens pro is like gold to me. It's inexpensive. And helps tremendously against my chronic pain. Good luck."	TENS 7000 2nd Edition Digital TENS Unit with 5 Modes and Timer	https://www.tenspros.com/

3769	Barbara Rhoades	O Fallon	12/16/2016	5	Mrs.	I have been in PT and had a machine that I thought was a TENS. The therapist said no but I watched him and his machine does EXACTLY what this one does. It is easy to work and does the same thing the PT's one did without the expense and time consumption. A chart of the megahertz ratings would be a nice addition to the next manufacturing of the TENS 7000. I love the hard case to keep everything together. If you have been thinking about a TENS machine, this one is priced right and works great.	TENS 7000 2nd Edition Digital TENS Unit with 5 Modes and Timer	https://www.tenspros.com/

3793	Sciatica Sufferer	Pacific Northwest	09/15/2016	4	Tens 7000 owner	"I learned about TENS from my physical therapist. I was in misery and was willing to try anything. I was skeptical at first, but it definitely allows me to function. TENS does not eliminate my pain. But, TENS allows me to stand and walk for longer periods. Apparently, the electrical stimulation interrupts the pain signal to the brain (i.e. the brain concentrates on the electrical stimulation and not pain). This in turn allows me to perform daily tasks that I can not do without using TENS.
I purchased the TENS 7000 vs the TENS 3000 because I thought I would need ""more power"". But, I found I don't use an intensity higher than a ""level 3"". That brings me to my only complaint about the unit. While the display is great (i.e. self explanatory and easy to read), the unit needs a display for the intensity controls. I suggest a display for the intensity so you can read if you are setting an intensity of say 2.8 versus 3.2. This is a relatively minor complaint. Overall, I love it."

3809	Julia M Cruz	Arlington, VA	06/15/2016	5	Dr.	I have used a TENS unit since 2007& this is the best unit I have used. I have owned 5 different units from 3 different brands, This one is as excellent as my best unit, EWE 2000 model & much less expensive. It is light but sturdy. Control buttons are covered by clear window & prevent inadvertent changes due to clothing or body contact. The battery is easy to remove & the clip on feature is easy to use but reliably firm. Readout of battery power feature is helpful for managing battery changes before going out or to sleep. The square electrodes that came with it are not irritating. Why does Medicare not cover this cost?? One of my former insurance carrier while I was employed cover it in one state. A different carrier in another state did not. My acupuncture provider (not my neurosurgeon, pain specialist or rheumatologist) suggested TENS first & it allowed me to decrease my medications & improve my pain level. I have been educating my students & residents on the use of these devices. Anything that helps pain & decreases medication doses without side effects is worth a try!

3813	Richard	Texas	06/06/2016	5	Business owner	"I am very happy with this unit. I use it to relieve the neuropathy in my feet caused by diabetes. I would give the 7000 a 4-1/2 star rating for one issue. I am 6' 2"" and with the pads on my feet, the lead wires are just a bit short in order to put the unit in a comfortable place, so I have to put it between my legs just below my groin which makes it difficult to move around or walk with the unit hooked up. If the lead wires were just a foot or so longer, the unit would be perfect. Still I recommend it to anyone, so I'll go ahead with 5 stars. I has plenty of zap and the batteries last much longer than I expected for the amount of juice it puts out. Also, the 5 modes are enough to use the various impulses so as not to get ""burn out"" on any specific setting. It is extremely easy to use. I figured out all its functions without even looking at the instructions (in true male fashion)."	TENS 7000 2nd Edition Digital TENS Unit with 5 Modes and Timer	https://www.tenspros.com/

3857	Dusten	PA	02/06/2016	5	TENS 7000	I have a bad lower back and have purchased some of the more expensive units. This TENS unit works as well as the one I paid triple the cost.

I wear mine every day and I am the one that wears them out and that's because I drop them so much. The only thing I don't like is they don't fit tight enough when you hook thrm to your cloths.

It's the first one I've ever used at home and it's very easy to understand and just as good as what they use at physical therapy.

3892	(Verified Buyer) Kendra	ND	09/04/2015	5	RN	My husband has had nerve pain that shoots down his arm ever since he had surgery 1 year ago. We were using a rental tens from our medical supply store. Well, they wanted us to purchase it for >$300. I think not! I did my research and found this one that has more modes and more power than the one we were previously renting. He thinks it works better and it's easy to use. A little heavier than his old one as he likes to clip it on his shirt while sleeping. Came within two days if shipping.

She purchased it and got the same fabulous pain free results. Only drawback is it eats up the battery life. I've found that removing the battery after use have been working out alot better for me. Weak battery equates to weak stimulation. All in all a great product.	TENS 7000 2nd Edition Digital TENS Unit with 5 Modes and Timer	https://www.tenspros.com/

3903	Lisa	Pennsylvania	07/19/2015	5	Patient	I was extremely pleased with the TENS 7000 for at-home use. I have osteoarthritis and it does provide effective pain relief. It is especially nice for the foot, which is tough to operate on. I learned about TENS from my orthopedic surgeon and physical therapist. I would advise any other patient purchasers to follow the advice of their doctor or physical therapist regarding its use at home. It doesn't cure arthritis but it does provide good pain relief without paying for a PT appointment for a TENS treatment. In fact, since you are in control of the intensity, you can adjust it perfectly to your comfort.	TENS 7000 2nd Edition Digital TENS Unit with 5 Modes and Timer	https://www.tenspros.com/
3904	Eilene	Kansas City	07/16/2015	4	Ms	I purchased this unit, hoping it would be similar to the one my doctor rented to me. It was similar. It is actually better than the one from my doctor, because the settings are more gradual. I find the case to be a little difficult to open and close, but that is no big deal for me. I would recommend this one to a friend.	TENS 7000 2nd Edition Digital TENS Unit with 5 Modes and Timer	https://www.tenspros.com/

3908	JWM	Georgia	07/06/2015	5	MR.	I had tried two different TENS before trying this unit. I was impressed and have used it many time for sore mussels. A friend asked to try it and was sold immediately and order one for himself. When you order the unit go ahead and order a couple additional packages of stimulation pads. Yo will find that once you start using the TENS 7000 you will use it more and more. The price is right so don't hesitate.

3913	Dennis	Ozark Country	06/22/2015	5	Mr	30 years ago (when I was in my 20's) I was smooshed between 2 semi trucks on the highway. For 2 years I used a tens unit to help me strengthen and regain use of my back injuries. Now in my mid 50's and arthritis sets in, I am hurting pretty bad. I hook up to my TENS 7000 - 2nd Edition and after a short time, I feel alive again. Maybe not like I am 20 again, but not like I was. My body will never be perfect again, but my TENS makes life much more pleasant. Thank you TENS!	TENS 7000 2nd Edition Digital TENS Unit with 5 Modes and Timer	https://www.tenspros.com/

I like the ability to change the modes to fit my needs, the amount of time it can be set to run. I has really helped my back pain. The only recommendation I would give is to buy a rechargeable battery/charger. I go through a 9v. battery about every 2 weeks with my present usage of 4 hrs. per day. (2 hrs. in morning; 2 hrs.in evening).	TENS 7000 2nd Edition Digital TENS Unit with 5 Modes and Timer	https://www.tenspros.com/

I still have a huge quantity left and am planning to take them to the pharmacy to be destroyed as I have no further use for them. I highly recommend the TENS unit to everyone who has chronic pain or even suffering from temporary pain from an accident or surgery or whatever. I love my TENS unit!!

3920	DOUG	Sumner	05/19/2015	5	it has been wonderful	I would like to thank your company for providing such a service. I am a disabled veteran (Air Force) with nerve damage injuries in my arms and hands. Part of my therapy, while still in the service, was using a tens unit to help alleviate pain. It worked very well but, I had to turn in the unit when I was medically discharged. It has been years since I was able to receive any kind of relief (pain medicine NEVER worked). After receiving your unit it has been a huge blessing. I still recall the frequency settings from using the one I had in the service. I turned your unit on...INSTANT relief. I use the unit daily and it has been wonderful. I'm able to rest better now and even have been able to do things I haven't done in years. One more thing to add, the price for your units are amazingly low. When I first got out of the service tens units were available but, were very costly. I plan on ordering more from your company in the future. God bless you all!	TENS 7000 2nd Edition Digital TENS Unit with 5 Modes and Timer	https://www.tenspros.com/

3922	Robert	Maryland	05/10/2015	5	Happy Camper	Couldn't be happier for the purchase of this unit. It does everything needed and does it as well as the really expensive unit they used at Physical Therapy. To be honest, because of the low price, I expected a mediocre machine. I was extremely surprised and pleased with the quality and functionality and it is very easy to set up and use. I've used it for some time now and have changed out the battery once. It seems to last forever. I would highly recommend this unit to anybody in need.	TENS 7000 2nd Edition Digital TENS Unit with 5 Modes and Timer	https://www.tenspros.com/

I bought this TENS 7000 to help control the pain and there by reduce aking the pain killer to just bedtime to help me sleep. Continued use along with Physical Therapy and a home traction unit has given me my life back and I no longer fear having surgery for the time being.
I highly recommend the TENS 7000."	TENS 7000 2nd Edition Digital TENS Unit with 5 Modes and Timer	https://www.tenspros.com/
3924	Kay	Texas	05/05/2015	5	Nice!!	I was introduced to the TENS 5K unit by my pain mgmt doctor a couple of years ago. I have FM and degeneration of the C spine. It was awesome in getting through some rough neck pain! It died on one side within the year. By then my doc no longer carried them. So I went on an internet search that took me to tenspro.com. Knowing what I knew from my 'beginner' TENS, I wanted something that was not made of plastic, but still offered the other similarities to my 5K and just as affordable. Enter the 7000. Very well made! Even feels a touch heavier than the 5K. The controls are covered with snap shut covers. I do miss my favorite 'double pulse' mode, but make do with what all the modes the 7000 offers.The price is right. Had I known they were this inexpensive, I would have purchased here instead of the $50 out of pocket insurance deductible and the $150 they submitted to my insurance company!? Politics!!Tenspro was very quick to order from and exceptionally fast service!! Very happy with my purchase even happier that I found tenspro.com for affordable, drug free pain relief. A great selection to choose from! As well as the on stop shop for accessories such as replacement electrodes (a local medical appliance distributor wants $35 for just the electrodes!!?? Whoa!!).

After finishing physical therapy for my back problems with L4-L5, and an exposed nerve in my lower spine, my therapist suggested I get a TENS unit, preferably the TENS 7000. I ordered it and received it within several days. After beginning to use it, I had the same good relief with easing the tight muscles in my back as I did when I was in the actual PT sessions. It's a good product, priced fairly, easy to use and store away, and I'm really satisfied with it. I recommend it highly to others. :o)	TENS 7000 2nd Edition Digital TENS Unit with 5 Modes and Timer	https://www.tenspros.com/

3945	Sherry	Pennsylvania	03/14/2015	5	great product	I love my tens unit. I had one from my physical therapist from 20 years ago and it still works but has no cover over the intensity controls so I was always zapping myself. This unit takes care of that problem and is much lighter than the old one. It's very easy to use and you can't beat the price. The only thing I don't like is the electrodes that come with it. I would not call the reusable as I had to tape them on after the first use, even wetting didn't help. But I do recommend this unit highly.

3953	Larry Russell	Asheville, NC	03/03/2015	5	Mr.	I've had a number of Tens Units over the past fifteen years. At first, you had to go through a doctor to get one, and they were very expensive. They've made valuable changes over the years, and the 2nd Edition Digital Tens Unite with 5 modes and a timer is by far the best. Sturdy. The various modes do different things to your back, so you can adjust it to your condition. The electrodes can be used for a longer period of time than any other Tens units I've had.

I have degenerative discs in my lower back and when they pinch my nerve the pain is severe. I am happy to say that I don't need the Tens unit daily but when I get an attack, it really does a great job. I would suggest that you order additional electrode pads at the time you order this unit as it will save you shipping costs. Depending on where you intend to use this, you may want to order the larger pads as they cover more surface area. In any case, you won't be disappointed.

Works like a charm every time, has a wide range of settings, and the battery has lasted for quite a few hours already. Nothing negative to report at all.

3998	Sean	Utah	11/13/2014	5	Wonderful unit	"I injured my back when I was 12 in an accident, and ever since then it will spasm horribly every so often. Whenever it does this, I'm in severe pain for weeks at a time.
A few months ago, it did this to me so badly that I couldn't even use my computer at work without wincing involuntarily. This was bad, since I'm in IT. My coworker noticed and brought in his TENS 2000. He handed it to me with a sealed pack of electrodes and told me to how he arranges them on his back when it bothers his. He then told me to go to the restroom and put it on. By the end of the day, I was feeling so much better. I went to give it back to him at the end of my shift, but told me to keep it until I could get one of my own.
I started looking around for one locally, but was not finding what I wanted (based on my research and experience with that TENS 2000), so I went online. That's when I found picked up one of these TENS 7000 tenspros.com.
As I was looking at the different units, I saw the TENS 7000. It looks like the same manufacturer as the on my friend lent me, but with more features, so I went ahead and got it (for a quarter of what I would have spent locally for the other one!), and I couldn't be happier with it!
The different modes are nice for different areas of the body, and the adjustablity of the different parameters of the signal it sends through the pads is great. I've just finished with another back spasm, and instead of a recovery time of weeks before the pain is gone with medication alone, a combination of this unit and medication cured this spasm in days.
A tens unit doesn't help with all pain, but what it does, it does very, very well. If you are in the market for an affordable yet effective tens, get this one!"	TENS 7000 2nd Edition Digital TENS Unit with 5 Modes and Timer	https://www.tenspros.com/
3999	Petra	Columbia SC	11/06/2014	5	Worth the money	I have used several TENS units and have found this one to be very good and compact enough to take traveling. With several settings and the ability to use 2 or 4 electrodes it's versatile and easy to use. It's so strong that neither me or my husband have been able to go above 3 in the strength and it can go up to 8. After 2 months of fairly steady use, I finally had to change the battery. I definitely recommend this product. It's as good as some of the more expensive units. The only thing I would change is the ability for it to go through a variety of different pulses without having to change the setting.

The second set of pads seem to work, but I am disappointed that the first set of pads does not work. If it weren't for that, I would have given it a 5.

4036	(Verified Buyer) William West	Trinity NC	07/15/2014	5	Worth every penny!	I have a torn meniscus in my left knee which my doctor said I would need surgery to repair, a friend recommended trying one of these as he had some shock therapy on his back and thought this would be worth a try. Before using this, I could barley walk up and down steps, the throbbing pain in my knee would wake me up several times during the night, and when walking, I had to be careful as to not put too much pressure on that leg when I stepped. After using this, the pain has dissipated about 85%, I no longer have the throbbing pain in my knee during the day or at night when I sleep. I know eventually I will need the surgery on my knee but at least until I can afford to take the six weeks of recovery off of work, this is working out great. Since I had great results with this, my friend that suggested it has purchased one, another guy at work that overheard us talking about it purchased one and after using it for a couple of weeks and found out how well it did work, purchased 2 more for family members. I would highly recommend the TENS 7000!	TENS 7000 2nd Edition Digital TENS Unit with 5 Modes and Timer	https://www.tenspros.com/

My unit works extremely well in all modes, is very powerful and lasts a long time on each battery. I have used it with both the gel patch electrodes and other electrodes and it's very effective at transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulatation. The unit and all of the accessories all seem to be very well made, I've used it about two months now, and I especially like that the unit can be set for either untimed/continuous use or to shut itself off after one hour.
The included tyco gel pad electrodes are very long lasting, particularly when cleaned after use and returned to the protective zip-closure pouch. I'm still using the first set of four pads"	TENS 7000 2nd Edition Digital TENS Unit with 5 Modes and Timer	https://www.tenspros.com/

4053	BitcoDavid	Woburn, MA	05/31/2014	5	Tens 7000	"My history with TENS and EMS goes back years. But for the past year, I've been experimenting with using them for sleep. TENS machines and EMS machines can be used to eliminate symptoms of Restless Leg Syndrome, spasms and nocturnal leg cramps. The problem is, all commercially available - consumer grade - machines have shutoff timers. My TENS 7000 does not. I can wear it all night long with no difficulty.
As to the product itself, it's peerless. Take it from someone who's been experimenting with TENS machines, since the 1980s. This machine is absolutely everything I've ever wanted in a TENS machine.
The company's service and price point is also flawless.

4059	Richard Stearns	Pensacola, FL	04/19/2014	5	Mr.	This is my 3rd TENS unit, purchased as a replacement for my original unit with similar capabilities, which it performs admirably. However, I also have a dual function unit which has the EMS Muscle Stimulator capability, which I find much more useful in treating my wife's back problems. In hind site I have to recommend purchasing a dual mode unit given the small additional price difference.	TENS 7000 2nd Edition Digital TENS Unit with 5 Modes and Timer	https://www.tenspros.com/

4066	Deb	Arizona	03/15/2014	3	electrodes	I like the TENs unit! I dont like that it turns off automatically after 1 hour. The problem i have though is with the electrodes. It is warm here and I sweat, so the electrodes 'gel' gives out and it loosenes and i get 'shocks'. I do a lot of walking (therapeutic) and dont know what to do with this as it helps me SO much but as soon as I sweat..no go.

I would strongly recommend it for severe pain relief. My husband suffers from nerve pain in his lower back and can't sleep many nights lying in bed staring at the ceiling fan wondering when the pain will stop and if he wants to even try to get out of the bed.

4068	Jack	California	03/12/2014	3	TENS 7000	This unit peaks at 5 of 10 and holds at that level - strong!. This was a replacement for one that acted exactly the same. I would wait until they have sold all of this particular batch before ordering one. My previous 7000 worked smoothly throughout the entire 1 - 10 range until it died. It was a great, adjustable, pain reliever and I miss it.	TENS 7000 2nd Edition Digital TENS Unit with 5 Modes and Timer	https://www.tenspros.com/
4069	(Verified Buyer) Shane	South Carolina	03/12/2014	5	Great Way to lower Narcotic medication intake	I ordered my first TENS 7000 from TENSPros over 1 year ago, and misplaced it during home renovation, and recently ordered my 2nd unit as a replacement. I suffer from moderately severe low back pain in the L4-L5 area due to a high-speed head-on auto accident. My doc has me on Norco 10/325mg every 6 hours, and Tylenol #4 w/ Codeine (60mg Codeine) every 6 hours, alternating, taking a pill approx. every 3 hours. This TENS unit has allowed me to lower the amount of narcotics consumed. It took a while to find the perfect setting, but after that the treatment sessions reduce my pain from a 8 on a 1-10 scale, down to about a 5-6 with a 45-60 minute session. My TENS Settings: Width: 150uS; Rate: 75Hz; Duration 30-60 minutes, single channel, dial position 3.5-4; using 2 electrodes that are 2x2 inches square (SantaMedical brand from Amazon) Bottom line...If you're in chronic pain, give this unit a try, you won't be sorry.

4080	Derick	Houston, Tx	01/25/2014	5	TENS 7000	I bought the TENS unit after getting the treatment at my chiropractor. I really enjoyed it in the office and figured I could continue the treatment between office visits. The TENS 7000 is small, but powerful. I only use it at a 3 and there's plenty of power left if needed. The battery lasts quite a long time, once replaced with a quality battery. One is included, but it's a cheap battery. Just a simple 9 volt energizer is fine. Be sure to get the spray for the pads as it will dramaticly increase their life. Just spray them after each use and they're just as sticky as new. I highly recommend this unit. Affordable and effective.	TENS 7000 2nd Edition Digital TENS Unit with 5 Modes and Timer	https://www.tenspros.com/

Went to my othopedic doctor, he took x-rays, did a bone scan and even went so far as to run some lab tests. Everything was working fine, no infection noted. Diagnoised it as sciatic nerve. I had a couple of adjustments and purchased my Tens unit. Within 2 weeks I was pain free. Now when I feel pain coming on, I put the Tens unit on it for a while and can say it works and I don't have to go through all that pain and expense.

4085	Chris Domres	Raleigh NC	01/20/2014	5	Tens 7000 review	I was spending $100 twice a week for a chiropractor to apply her TENS unit to my strained and inflamed back muscles. I bought the 7000 on sale and used the 7000 every day for a couple of weeks and my muscles healed faster than the twice a week visits to the chiropractor. The 9 volt battery has been changed only twice. This thing can pump out a heavy painful dose of electric current. One has to slowly adjust the current level to avoid being shocked painfully. The unit has a nice selection of current patterns and pulses to choose from. It is nice and small, about the size of a cigarette box. I used it while on long drives to keep my lower back pain from getting worse.	TENS 7000 2nd Edition Digital TENS Unit with 5 Modes and Timer	https://www.tenspros.com/

4093	G Collins	Portland, OR	12/04/2013	5	All around a great little machine!	It took me awhile to figure out the right settings, but once I did this machine has worked wonders on me! I have tendinitis in both my ankles from overuse (I used to be a gymnast so the constant pounding on the floor took its toll after many years). I had tried medications... one worked for the pain but left me feeling nauseous and when I switched medications the other one had no effect! I wasn't thrilled about taking pills to manage the pain so when I discovered TENS as a natural way to manage pain I jumped on it. This is a great little unit, I love how compact it is and it has a really long battery life. The sticky pads have also lasted me quite awhile. One feature I really love is the little cover that closes the dials so you don't risk accidentally bumping it when in use. I used it everyday when I first got it but now I only use my TENS machine a few times a week as the pain in my ankles has become more manageable. I would recommend this unit to anybody, I have been very pleased with it.	TENS 7000 2nd Edition Digital TENS Unit with 5 Modes and Timer	https://www.tenspros.com/

4098	Jim	North Carolina	11/15/2013	5	Get one, you won't regret it!	"My wife and I have purchased three of these, not because they wear out or break but because they are great. I was having some back pain and I thought the chiropractor’s TENS gave me the most relief so I bought one of my own. Probably one of the best purchases I’ve ever made. I don’t know why but lots of people seem reluctant to try one. I finally got my wife to try it and she loved the relief it gave her. As I’m away from home a lot and take my unit with me we bought another one for her. Somehow I pulled something in my back on day two of a two-week motorcycle trip and I was uncomfortable for at least half the trip. I sure wish I had brought the TENS unit with me. It’s compact enough that I don’t take trips without it anymore. My brother in law has had back pain for quite some time. We recommended a TENS unit for him but he wouldn’t order one for himself. We ordered the third unit and had it shipped to him. Guess what? He loves it too!
All of the units we’ve bought were the TENS 7000 models. I’ve had mine since January 2011. One month later, in February 2011 we bought my wife’s unit. We bought the last unit in August 2013. We all like them and have had no problems with any of them. I’d recommend these to anyone as they offer a lot of relief for a small amount of money."

4110	Bill	Pittsburgh PA	10/16/2013	5	MR	The unit works great. Enough settings that if one becomes uncomfortable you can change it. The ONLY thing I don't like is the cords for the electrodes separate even though there are little plastic guides that try to help prevent it. They slide so easily the cords still separate. The thing with the cord is that the cords have gotten shorts in them where they connect to the unit. Thereby giving you a jolt if you think you have it set where you want it but you really don't and have it set too high. This has happened because I tend to where it in my pocket because it's uncomfortable to where on my side. It digs in when I move.
