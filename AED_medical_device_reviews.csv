35	Dougchilson	11/24/2023	1	Not the greatest	"""I called on Oct 30th to place an order over the phone. We had a hiccup with payment on the phone using my HSA but then the rep said everything was fine and it went through. The next day I thought that was a decent deal on the aed I ordered and decided to purchase another one for a family member. Went online on OCT 31st and placed my order online everything went through smoothly. I called the company on 11-1 and informed them I have not received tracking information for my first order yet I have already received information for my second order. My family received  their order on 11-3 I called the company once again and was assured my order would ship out that day and I would most likely receive it over the weekend or the latest on 11/06. Today is 11-06 I have not received my aed yet, I called around 11 am today to figure out what’s going on they said that the order was in the dock and going to be expedited to me with 2 day shipping. At 445 today I received a voicemail from the original sales person saying there was an issue with my purchase once again and that I would need to contact my Hsa bank but the aed company closes in 15 minutes. So frantically and very frustratingly I contacted my Hsa bank who stated they did not hold the charge it’s the aed company who doesn’t accept the card, but plenty of funds available to cover this charge. So contacted the sales rep once again and informed her what my Hsa company said so I asked her to run it through as an online order as that seemed like o be better than going through them. She claimed the order was processed and I will receive it by Wednesday. Only time will tell if they get it right this time around. I should have asked for something in return for all these mishaps on the companies behalf but chose not to. If I do not receive my order I will be returning the other one and making a bad review on the bbb website."""	https://americanaed.com/
