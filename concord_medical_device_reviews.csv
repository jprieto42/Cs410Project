2	Karen McCune 	 Indianapolis, IN United States	05/19/2023	5	perfect for people with Raynaud's syndrome.	Easy to use, ear piece attaches easily and firmly.  The continuous read is really nice to track recovery with exertion.  Quick reading.  Small enough to take to doctor's where they only have finger versions.

7	JESSE THURLOW 	 Kingsville, MD United States	10/24/2022	5	Concord Portable Handheld Pulse Oximeter Monitor	It comes with well cushioned protector. I bought it to take with me on walks.

I had no idea a non medical person could purchase an item like this.  It is amazing.   Accurate and easy to use.  I did get the ear piece because of my lung disease the therapist said I would not get an accurate reading on my finger.

13	j weeks 	 Tucson, AZ United States	02/19/2021	5	75023 pulse oximeter	i have only had the device for 2 days, but in that time it is fulfilling my needs for an ear lobe sensor oximeter. The finger tip oximeters did not provide adequate nor dependable readings as my finger tips seem to not have the response rate needed.  At this time I am very satisfied.

14	Anonymous Person		01/29/2021	5	Concord Pulse oximeter	I was in need of an accurate, easy to use pulse oximeter during a recent pulmonary infection. The unit functioned as advertised online and has performed perfectly. I highly recommend this product  to anyone seeking an accurate pulse oximeter at a reasonable price.

15	Simmons 	 Florida	10/03/2020	3	Gives accurate readings	As a CPAP wearer, I wanted to be sure my oxygen saturation was not dropping during sleep. I’m also a retired critical care nurse and have used this type of device on patients. It appears accurate and reliable. Cons- it does not keep a history to review later, after awakening. It did alarm once while I was sleeping, when my Saturation was below the alarm limits I set. There is no way of knowing if I had other events that I missed. The original batteries last three nights, so I use rechargeable batteries, which I change every three days. A more advanced monitor is  too costly.

16	Steven Geller 	 ELKRIDGE, MD United States	09/28/2020	5	more accurate than finger pulse ox	We purchased this because we were getting inaccurate readings from finger pulse oximeters.

18	Chandresh Patel 	 Livermore, CA United States	03/12/2020	5	Easy and accurate	I bought this to give me a more accurate reading of 02 saturations than the finger tip models, I have always noticed variances and my doctor said that ear and forehead monitors were more accurate. The model looks to be rugged, accurate and works great. I had a question which Concord Health answered promptly.

19	Charles Pefley 	 Seattle, WA United States	02/05/2020	4	Excellent Unit ...	I'm very pleased with my Pulse Oximeter #75023. I bought this unit specifically because it can use an ear clip probe. I need the ear probe because I frequently have poor circulation in my fingers and using the ear probe lets me monitor my O2 sat while working out on the treadmill. The oximeter comes with a protective rubber case that was extremely difficult to remove. Very hard for someone with limited finger strength. And the case must be removed to insert the batteries.  If it were not for the protective case issue I would give this unit all FIVE STARS.

21	Casey s 	 Utah	10/20/2019	4	Amazing, Peace of Mind	I am 25 years old and have recently run into really bad asthma attacks during the night. I am currently treating it and doing everything my doctor has suggested and prescribed to treat the asthma, but in the mean time while undergoing treatment, this product has given me peace of mind that if I do have an asthma attack while I sleep, either me or my wife will wake up to the alarm and I won't just die in my sleep. Would be five stars if there were an option to plug into the wall. Batteries are expensive and this goes through them FAST if you are using it for continuous monitoring.

52	Heart to Heart		02/10/2023	5	Love it	My husband and I love this handy cardio checker that we can use anytime. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s cool to see our EKG and the indicator on what the result is (as we donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t really know.)  My husband just went in for a minor surgery and we asked doctor if we could skip the EKG because we have a high deductible plan and would have to pay extra for that before being under anesthesia. The doctor agreed it would be fine because of husbandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s good health. In the meantime, I bought this device and it verified to us and the doctorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s nurse that his  EKG was normal and healthy for surgery.  As we age, it will be handy.  I plan to get one for my sister so she can share with her husband, both approaching age 70.

73	JESSE THURLOW 	 Kingsville, MD United States	10/24/2022	5	KardiaMobile EKG Monitor	I had an episode of possible Atrial Fibrillation (A Fib), so I bought this to monitor any recurrences. The A Fib was most likely induced by a statin I just started. The doc said most likely not the statin and directed me to resume it. I am a week now just getting over the allergic reaction to the statin. My lucky stars A Fib was not in the reaction mix. Comforting was having the KardiaMobile EKG Monitor to monitor my heart. The second day I received it I progressed from basic monitoring to the more extensive yearly plan to include Sinus rhythm studies. This device will not detect heart attacks, but with careful monitoring I was able to suffer through significant episodes of chest pain caused by reaction to the statin that were muscle/nerve related without summoning 911 or taking a trip to the ER.  Disclaimer: I have been a physical therapist for  46 years, so I have a strong understanding of the body and its response to pain.  If you have chest pain you do not understand-call 911.

83	Amelia Bowers 	 Toney, AL United States	08/30/2022	5	Great product	My cardiologist recommended I get a Kardia so I could record my EKG whenever I felt a flutter so we would be able to determine over time how often my afib was happening.

88	Guy Erdman 	 Forrestville , CA United States	08/22/2022	3		Sometimes it will register great connectivity and then at the end of the 30 seconds say there was interference and it can't give a reading. It has done this numerous times. this is quite frustrating because there is no way to tell how to correct it. I've tried dampening and cleanning the pads and this doesn't work.	KardiaMobile EKG Monitor [Original-Single Lead] by AliveCor	https://www.concordhealthsupply.com/
89	Virginia C 	 UT United States	08/22/2022	4	Kardia Mobile	"My doctor suggested I get a smart watch or Kardia Mobile. The watches were pricey so I opted for the KM. It has taken me about 3 days to get a reading as my phone isn't compatible but my tablet is. Also, there are only 3 rhythms it shows. Mine shows "" normal sinus rhythm"" (which is great) or ""unclassified."" If I'm reading and understanding what ""unclassified"" means I should purchase the other 3 rythmns for a monthly fee or yearly fee. It's good for showing if you do or do not  have a problem with afib. I don't regret getting it."	KardiaMobile EKG Monitor [Original-Single Lead] by AliveCor	https://www.concordhealthsupply.com/
90	Bryan 	 Burlington ontario Canada	08/21/2022	5	Debit not accepted by kardia	I tried to get full coverage for all heart arrhythmias but they only take credit cards. Why don't  they allow debit or google pay for people that aren't  dumb enough to have credit cards? The only heart problem it detects is Afib without full coverage.

In the past he tried hooking me up with a ten day monitoring devise that was awful. It was like wearing an EKG machine for ten days. Kardia is simple and allowed me to take a reading when I felt an event was taking place. After using Kardia for one week it picked up an arterial fib event yesterday.

167	Anonymous Person 	 San Jose, CA United States	06/16/2023	5	Oximeter	"This was purchased for my elderly dad. He has a rule of buying products made in the USA. The Nonin Onyx Vantage, not only satisfied my dad's purchase requirement but has also been an excellent ""tool"" to monitor his heart rate and  especially his 02 levels when he feels winded. Another reason this particular oximeter was purchased was due to my dad's dark skin pigmentation. The oximeter is easy to use and the Concord representative that coordinated the processing of my dad's prescription was very responsive on updating my sister on ordering and shipping."

173	Charles Sherwood 	 Salt Lake City , UT United States	02/28/2023	5	Evaluation of this unit	I am a retire physician and have purchased at different times four of these pulse oximeters: personal use, church emergency kit, and friend with asthma.  I have used them for emergency evaluations in each situation and am very pleased.  Two counter intuitive caveats that should be understood about putting in the batteries: 1)  the battery lid must be pushed toward the  small gap at the finger opening of the unit to open (don't pull toward you)  (2)  The batteries go in reverse directions to make the unit operate, however, the two springs side by side make you think the negative ends of both batteries fit against the springs.  The unit won't work if the batteries an not put in exactly as directed.  I don't store batteries in the unit in case they spoil and ruin the unit.  In an emergency situation, these non-intuitive steps and cause confusion and delay.

228	ed01432 	 Ayer, MA United States	01/11/2021	5	Nonin Onyx Vantage 9590 Oximeter	Just recently received the 9590, and it seems to be an accurate, well constructed device.  In comparing the 9590 with the still working well 9500 model, accuracy seems to be about the same, speed of operation about the same, and low profusion operation about the same.  The 9590 is smaller and provides many many more spot checks on a set of batteries.  If you own an operational 9550 or 9500 and the improvement in spot check number is not important to you, then I see no need to upgrade to the 9590. One additional comment: The battery compartment for the 9590 likely provides an additional improvement. The 9500 is sensitive to the voltage drop resulting from battery terminal corrosion which might require occasionally swabbing the terminals using a Q-Tip and rubbing alcohol, easily done.

Although I was disheartened by the oximeters I had purchased, I still needed one. When I went to the hospital for outpatient tests, I asked the nurse to write down the information of the oximeter she used on me. When I came home, I got online and ordered from your company.

371	Critical Care Physician 	 Warwick, RI United States	12/13/2016	5	Nonin Onyx Vantage 9590 finger pulse oximeter	This pulse oximeter is more sensitive than the model I used in my Office and Hospital practice at Middlesex Hospital, Middletown CT from 2003-2005.It sensed and accurately measured HR and O2 sat. while I wore examination gloves(compared to fingers on the same hand wo gloves. In acute care situations I measured more quickly and more accurately than using hospital room pulse oximeters.No longer do I have to worry about patients with darker skins or those with nail polish only. NOTE- I didn't use it for patients with glued-on or synthetic nails.I used it while employed as a locum tenens physician paid an hourly salary..If I received productivity or coded separately, using this could have increased my collections and paid for this unit many times over.

372	Teresa P. 	 Long Beach, CA United States	12/07/2016	5	Reliable, acurate pulse oximeter	This is my second Nonin Onyx Vantage oximeter. I had to replace my first one after 5 years. I had it repaired once under the 4 year warranty at no charge. It died last week and I immediately ordered the same one in same color(red) because I love it so much.  I'm a respiratory therapist in an acute care setting, primarily ICU.  I often like to double check bedside monitors. I find that mine is at least or more accurate when comparing to ABGs. I ordered the new one on a Wednesday and Concord had it to me by Monday the following week. Free shipping. Only without it for one shift! :)	Nonin Onyx Vantage 9590 Finger Adult/Pediatric Pulse Oximeter. #1 Professional Oximeter Made in USA - Includes Free Carrying Case	https://www.concordhealthsupply.com/
373	Lew Llewellyn 	 Norwalk, CT United States	11/14/2016	5	ACCURATE, RELIABLE PRODUCT	I have been on oxygen therapy for 3 1/2 years, and have used several different Pulse Oximeters. IMO, based on actual use, the 9590 is the most accurate oximeter available. I purchased my first 9590 in 2013 from Concord, and was very satisfied. However, I recently lost that one, and thought it was so good, I had to have another. I tried using another Mfgr's oximeter, but was not as satisfied wit it compared to the Nonin 9590. With the 9590, you just put your finger in the unit...no need to push a button before inserting your finger. The readout is very bright, and easy to read in any lighting. I have found that the Nonin consistently reads lower O2 than other units. All oximeters read within 20% accuracy, but Nonin sets their units to be safer by reading on the lower side...I have found it to be 2-3 less O2 level than others. The Nonin agrees more with my doctors readings than other units. Lastly, there is no better price and service than Concord Health Supply for the Nonin 9590!

395	Tony M 	 Mars Hill, NC	01/15/2016	5	The BEST Oximeter	If You Exercise, There's Only One Finger Oximeter For You! After ordering no less than five (5) finger pulse oximeters from Amazon, I finally found one that does what it says it’s supposed to do:  accurately measure pulse rate and SpO2! All five of the “Chinese” manufactured finger pulse oximeters ordered from Amazon could not measure pulse rate while exercising on a treadmill.  The accuracy was poor on all five as well.  If one keeps their arm, hand, and fingers perfectly still, the ordered oximeters will function.  But if you’d like to monitor your workout on a treadmill or other exercise machine, there’s only one finger pulse oximeter that I found does what it says, the NONIN Onyx Vantage 9590. NONIN invented finger pulse oximeters, and their products are produced in the U.S.A.  The 9590 comes with a 4-year warranty as well!  Unfortunately, at this time Amazon doesn’t carry the NONIN Onyx Vantage 9590, and it must be ordered from other on-line suppliers.  I purchased my 9590 from Concord Health Supply, Inc. (888-970-2999). Amazon Prime courteously refunded each of the “defective” oximeters I originally purchased, including shipping.  ‘Cudos to Amazon Prime! What sets the NONIN Onyx Vantage 9590 apart from other finger oximeters is its ability to “ignore” vibration and motion while still providing accurate pulse and %SpO2 measurements!  I found that by inserting the “bird” finger into the 9590 and then curling my fingers into my hand while rotating my palm up, I was able to move my arms and still obtain accurate readings.  Not so with any of the other “Chinese oximeters.”  And if you have a question about the product, you can call NONIN in the USA! In fact, NONIN actually has documented tests validating the feature they call PureSAT Technology for accurate readings even when the 9590 is in motion!Yes, the NONIN Onyx Vantage 9590 costs more than the inaccurate, intermittent “Chinese oximeters” but if you’re truly interested in fast, accurate readings when motionless or when working out and moving, the NONIN Onyx Vantage 9590 is a bargain!  Learn from my failed experiences with cheap imitation “Chinese oximeters”.  Don’t waste your time and $$$, get the NONIN Onyx Vantage 9590 first and avoid aggravation and anxiety!

The Nonin Onyx is the single best pulse ox I have ever used. My first Nonin lasted almost 6 years before I needed to purchase a replacement. It has so many details that make it superb: the readout, the user finger grip, the ease of battery changing, the lovely long lanyard, and it comes in purple! I would recommend a Nonin to anyone needing a hard-working, affordable pulse ox.

500	Anonymous Person 	 New York, NY United States	01/18/2014	5	Fine, except for shipping.	"The Nonin (the second one I've bought) is excellent. My only dissatisfaction is with the choice of USPS for shipping. The ""Tracking"", after the initial shipping entry, went AWOL for four days, leaving me in the dark as to the status of my order. When it arrived, the paper bag was forced into my mailbox, instead of being left with the doorman. I realize this is not the fault  of Concord, but the sensitive Nonin would have  been better served by Fedex or UPS."

557	Thomas 	 New Smyrna Beach, FL United States	03/26/2013	4	Best oximeter on the market for the general public	I have had cheaper products that work well when your oxygen saturation was good, but if hovering around 90 you may never get a reading and in many cases you'll know the reading is wrong. This unit works every time and it let's you know when the reading needs to be redone by not displaying the 'green light' I am confident this unit is the best bang for the buck.My only disappointment is that it's a little larger than the Non in 9500 units I have seen used by the respiratory therapist's at my Pulmonologist's office, however it seems to be just as quick, easy to read, and I think will be just as accurate---only time will tell but the 9590 runs circles around my $100 unit!

563	Lisa Maria 	 Winchester, CA United States	03/11/2013	5	Accuracy at it's Best!!	I love my new Nonin Onyx 9590!  I read all the online reviews about many different Pulse Ox and talked to several other Registered Respiratory Therapist before making my final purchase.  They all concurr.....the Nonin Onyx Vantage 9590 is the best for accuracy, reliability and durability.  I purchased the Purple, and it is perfect.  I would love to have spent less money, but I'm not willing to risk my patients life for a cheaper and potentially less accurate device.  Somethings are worth the investment, this is definitely one of them!

564	Susan Cammerer 	 Brentwood, CA United States	03/08/2013	5	Nonin Onyx	"Last summer my first Nonin died on me. Urgently needing a replacement but not having the funds I let myself be talked into a ""cheap"" brand. I was unhappy from the first day. I tolerated the poor quality and performance for 6 months and went back to Nonin. I am SO happy with my new Onyx! It reads almost immediately, it doesn't slip off my patients finger, it shows the readout for several seconds after taking it off the pt, it's easy to hold and use. Never again will I take the ""cheap"" way. It's Nonin or nothing. Thank you!"

678	AJ Bilbrey, CRT, RPSGT 	 Manchester, TN United States	11/03/2011	4	CRT, RPSGT	This pulse ox works great.  The image does not change in a way in order to read O2 in different positions as it did with my cheaper pharmacy pulse ox.  It takes about the same time to pick up/read O2 but I have always been able to get a reading with my new Nonin pulse ox versus the cheaper brand.  Low perfusion or cold hands is no more of a challenge other than having to wait a few more seconds or a minute before it reads, but I always get a reading where I was unable to get a reading on cold hands or low perfusion with the cheaper pulse ox.  If anything, it has saved me much time on my RT rounds due to the effectiveness and multi-purpose( adults & pediatric).  Anything that helps my work go smoother has definately got my vote.

764	RWC 	 FAIRFAX, VA United States	04/16/2020	5	Glad to have found Concord & this Pulse Oximeter	"After a friend who had gone through COVID-19 recommended having a home pulse oximeter (their Dr had recommended it), I discovered Concord (through a NYT/Wirecutter review that mentioned the Nonin Onyx with link to this company). While that one was a bit pricey for me, this version fit the bill perfectly and despite the ""out of stock"" label next to item color names, I was able to put it in cart and order. It arrived within the week and seems more accurate than the mobile phone app I was using.... Also, for those of you who might be puzzled initially by upside down display, press button again and it flips. This was explained on site (and in video) as ""rotating display for user/caregiver"" but I didn't pay attention to it the first time - now I understand. Stay healthy!"

"Purchased this pulse ox as an occupational therapist that floats between facilities.  Now I never have to figure out where the facility one is located, I come with my own!  Loved the option to choose my cover color.  Quite affordable for all the ""extras"" that come with it and often have patients inquiring about where they can get one of their own."

1108	Sherise Molten RN 	 Port Saint Lucie, FL United States	09/26/2013	5	Love my Pulse Ox	As a RN working the floor a Pulse Ox is a handy tool to have in your pocket. The first day I had this at work it was helpful. My favorite color is green and that was the deal sealer for me. Besides everyone has a black or white one and they can be easily mistaken for someone else's. Mine definitely stands out as no one else has a green one. Very neat packaging. Love the rubber case for the Pulse Ox although with the rubber case it's a tight squeeze into the black pouch (it still does fit and close properly) I say the only downside is the monitor does not reach 100%. Highly recommend this to anyone.	Concord Fingertip Pulse Oximeter with Reversible Display, Carrying Case and Lanyard	https://www.concordhealthsupply.com/

1137	Todd 	 Gresham, OR	05/05/2013	4	Compact Pulse Ox	I purchased this item as it was on sale and came with a 2 year warranty. I work in a SNF and our equipment takes some abuse. My previous pulse oximeter lasted about 3 months before giving up the ghost.  This item is currently fulfilling its place in my arsenal and operating as it should. It is an attractive item (as much as a pulse ox can be) and the blue cover should offer some shock protection. I would have to admit the 2 year warranty was my primary reason for choosing this item.

I purchased this in 2020 right as covid was starting to run through the entire country, and my mom was showing multiple symptoms, so we needed something like this to help know when or if we needed to take things more seriously. I'd say it's a lifesaver, but I hope it doesn't have to get to that point. Can't thank Concord enough for having these available, discounted, and shipping IMMEDIATELY. I had no idea what to expect from this company I had never heard of, but taking that chance worked out perfectly. I'll definitely be coming back for medical supplies in the future.

1645	Anonymous Person 	 Douglasville, GA United States	05/29/2015	4	Evaluation of finger pulse oximeter	"The Concord Basics Finger Pulse Ox appears to fit appropriately and to give accurate readings. The only thing that I would suggest in the design of this device is to improve the ""readability"" of the numbers. Everyone in the household who has used this oximeter has had to look closely to interpret the reading because the digital read-out is difficult to discern. It's hard to differentiate between a ""9"" and a ""3"" or between an ""8"" and a ""6""."

Upon speaking with customer service, there isn’t an alternative to access the software like an app, a disk, or MAC. Because I have a product with no way to give the results to the doctor, is the reason I gave it 4 stars. I will say the representative tried to help and keep in touch, his service was great, there was just no resolution to the problem. I think the only way to get a resolution is to find a way to MAKE SURE the customer has a way to get the software if all else fails by having a back up.

1797	VicFan 	 Dublin, OH United States	12/07/2021	5	Replacement for ring pulse oximeter	I have used a ring overnight for probably 2.5 years now.  When I have an Afib problem, the ring records that as an elevated pulse rate with a really wide variety in pulse rates from one second to the next.  What I discovered with the ring is that the unit is sealed, so when the battery finally dies and will not hold a charge for the full night, the battery cannot be replaced.  While the manufacturer gives about a 50% discount on replacement units in that case, it was still more expensive than I paid for this unit.This unit provides more information for the doctor than the ring ever did.  This unit is calibrated for accuracy but the ring was not.  Finally, the sensor that is used with the instrument stays in place overnight and doesn't bother my sleep.

1805	Toby P 	 SD United States	04/07/2021	4	Good Pulse Ox Monitor/Alarm, No Options for Macs	Simple and easy to use, this pulse oximeter is the second one we've purchased over the years.  Our first Contec CMS-50F used micro USB which was the ultimate point of failure on the sensor side and facilitated the need for replacement.  I was pleasantly surprised to find the sensor/data connector has been upgraded to USB-C; which should provide longer life and a more solid connection.  We use this nearly every night and primarily rely on its function as an alarm which sounds when certain thresholds for pulse and SPO2 levels are crossed.  The software is Windows-only which makes it less convenient for Mac users and means third-party apps are required to pull the data. This incompatibility of the software with Mac drops it one star on my review.  The first version was robust and lasted many years of nearly daily use with the weak point eventually being the micro-USB which has been addressed in this later model.  I expect this model to provide many years of reliable service.

1820	Joseph Pavelchak 	 Lakewood, OH United States	08/20/2019	5	Trully an outstanding product.	This product is amazing.  Its small size is really deceiving.  It is very technologically advanced.  The product's design is a real work of art.  This Oximeter is very easy to use and the data is clearly displayed.  One of the best features of this Oximeter is that it can store data, which at a later time can be opened up, using the supplied software application, and then the data can be processed and printed out.  The data can also be saved to a PC data folder for future archival purposes.The products comes with a printed sheet of instructions but I would very much recommend that one take the time and print out the entire user/tech manual (which can be accessed at any time from the supplied software and do a review of the contents to be aware of all that this wonderful products can deliver.I very highly recommend this specific model, CMS50F, by Contec Medical Systems Co., Ltd, and would give it a 6 ****** if possible.

1821	Anonymous Person 	 United States	07/19/2019	5	Excellent device for the price	I bought this after buying a 'vibrating ring' model for twice the price, which did not work as well ( the vibration would not wake me up ).  This unit DOES wake me up and has worked every time so far when my O2 has gone below the limit. The reports are EXCELLENT. I download them every morning and gave a week's worth to the sleep study doctor that I'm seeing, who said they were very useful.The only drawback I find is that you need to be somewhat tech-savvy to use and program the unit. Highly recommended otherwise.	Wrist-Worn Pulse Oximeter with Digital Software Download and Download Cable	https://www.concordhealthsupply.com/
1822	Anonymous Person 	 Denver, CO United States	06/18/2019	5	OK product but documentation is weak	Software and data download to my 10 year old, hp Vista laptop, via supplied usb cable works ok. (Their Bluetooth option for data connection is not available on my old laptop.) The 30 page user guide is not too useful, and hard to follow, due to the ‘Chinese-English’ grammar construction of the sentences. However, just using the old ‘poking around’ method works ok for understanding this simple, basic interface.

1823	Gerald Carlson 	 Huntley, IL United States	05/09/2019	5	Using the wrist pulse oximeter	This device is easy to use and to date has worked very well.  The software is another story.  I've used it for 65 days in a row now and have figured out the software, but it's quirky; just stay with it and look on YouTube for instructions.  I print out the report summary each morning after wearing it all night.  This seems to be a good value.  There doesn't seem to be anything on the market for near this price.

2048	Anonymous Person 	 Brooklyn, NY United States	05/06/2020	5	For Once A Great Item Came In Good Condition!	During the past few years it has been increasingly hard to get items shipped on time and in good condition. This problem has worsened during the pandemic. While the Sani-Hands Wipes were delayed a bit--it was not for long.  Although there was no protective padding inside the outer carton, the boxes were placed close together and did not get crushed, or open up, get wet, dirty, etc. This is a great product which I have used for years. I hate hand sanitizers with scent and that leave your hands sticky and smear everything  touched. These wipes are odorless, come in individual packets that can be carried anywhere, and leave hands feeling clean, not greasy. The expiration date was far in the future, so they will not dry out or lose effectiveness before they are used. I wish they were a little cheaper, but for this product, in these times, it's worth it.. Hopefully they will still be available when I need them again.
